r"""Fail a run of `tests/integration` that never reached its node.

pytest exits 0 for a module that skipped itself, so a job whose fixture
stopped finding the node stays green while asking it nothing -- for
`node-integration.yml`'s two btclib-node jobs, an install that succeeds
followed by an `import btclib_node` that raises under
`btclib_node_python`'s probe. `reusable-integration-bitcoind.yml`'s
"Fail if the node tests did not run" step is the same question for the
`bitcoind` job, asked there by failing on every skip. That cannot hold
here: a btclib-node run skips a test whose node does not declare the
capability it needs, and rule 4 of issue btclib-org/btclib#2220 makes
that skip a counted result rather than a defect.

So this fails on a report holding no testcase, or on a skip whose
message is not a capability's. A capability's message is read from
`capability.require` itself, by making it refuse each `Capability` in
turn, rather than copied here: the wording then has one home, and a
change to it moves this check with it. Every other skip -- no
`btclib_node` importable, no `bitcoind`, `TF2_INTEGRATION` unset -- is
a test that never reached a node, and fails the run. A capability's skip
does not: the fixture that found the node importable has already run by
the time a test asks for one.
