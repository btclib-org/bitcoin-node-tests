r"""Read Core's `test/functional/` and compare it to TF2.md, in two ways.

`check_vendored_vectors.py` re-checks a pin already in the ledger and
cannot see a file Core *gains*: it walks the ledger's own entries and
asks upstream about each, so a new `test_framework/*.py` is invisible to
it (issue btclib-org/btclib#1751). This script asks the other question:
what does Core's directory hold today, and does every file in it have an
entry here -- in both directions, so a file Core has removed is reported
too, distinctly from one it has gained.

The listing is `git/trees?recursive=1`, checked for `.truncated` rather
than assumed complete, and never `contents`: that endpoint lists a
directory non-recursively, so it would answer without every file under
`crypto/` and report each of them as gone -- the failure mode that reads
as a real finding and is not one.

The second read is the per-test ledger's pins. `check_vendored_vectors.py`
parses only the framework ledger's fenced blocks, so a row of the
per-test table is read here: each Core test file's pin is compared with
that file's last commit at the same tip of Core's default branch. A pin
`TF2.md` marks `held` is printed and left out of the issue, and listed
there only where it is at the tip, its marker then stale, or where no
commit upstream touches its path. Every row of the table is read or
refused, and a table with no row is refused, so that a row is never
skipped unread.

Each read reports under a title of its own, distinct from the other's
and from `check_vendored_vectors.py`'s per-pin drift title, so a gained
file, a stale framework pin and a stale per-test pin are never the same
issue and one report never overwrites another.
