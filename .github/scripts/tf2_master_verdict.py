r"""Classify a failure that appears only against Core built from `master`.

`node-integration.yml`'s `core-master` job runs the `*_bitcoind_test.py`
half of `tests/integration` twice in one workflow run: once against the
pinned release (the required `bitcoind` job, whose own JUnit report it
downloads) and once against a `bitcoind` this repository built from
Core's `master` itself. A test failing in the second report and not in
the first is measured the way `ISS 8`'s decision of 2026-09-25 lays down,
`TF2.md`'s pin for its Core test file against that file's last commit on
`master`, and this script names the outcome one of two ways:

- **stale port** -- the Core test file `TF2.md`'s per-test ledger pins
  the failing test to, or a data file it loads, has moved since that
  pin. The defect is this repository's own: the port was read from a
  revision upstream has since changed, and needs a fresh reading rather
  than a report to Core. The report line names the path that moved.
- **file unchanged since the pin** -- neither the file nor a data file it
  loads has a commit on `master` since the pin, and this names neither a
  cause nor an owner. Core's behaviour may have changed under that file,
  or under a different file; the failure may not reproduce; or
  the port may never have matched the file it cites: the required job
  passes such a port wherever the pinned release predates a behaviour
  change the pin already carries, and only `master` fails it
  ([ISS 143](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/143)).
  A pin compared with the file's last commit tells none of these apart,
  so the port is checked by hand against the pinned file's own
  expectation first.

The Core file a failing test names is read from the failing module's own
docstring rather than guessed from its filename: `p2p_invalid_messages_
bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_invalid_messages_misbehaving_bitcoind_test.py`
both port `p2p_invalid_messages.py`, so a module-name transform would
have to special-case exactly the pairing this avoids by reading what
every `*_bitcoind_test.py` module already states in its own first
paragraph, "Read from Core's `test/functional/<file>.py`" -- the same
sentence a human re-checking a row of `TF2.md`'s per-test ledger by hand
would read. Once the Core file is named, its pin comes from that
ledger's own table rather than from the module's docstring a second
time: the table is what a weekly re-check would move, where the
docstring is prose nothing here re-derives automatically.

The data files a Core test loads are `_DATA_FILES`, stated here rather
than parsed out of Core's file, which reaches them in more than one way:
an argument default, an `open()` beside `__file__`, a `from data import`.
Run from this tree, with `<core>` a Core checkout, this prints each cited
Core test beside each file of `test/functional/data/` whose name, less
its suffix, the test mentions as a word, which is what `_DATA_FILES`
holds; the package marker and the README are left out, `__init__` being
a method name as well. `awk` keeps the directory's own files, so
`data/util/` and what it holds are not read; no cited test reads it:

    git grep -h -o "Read from Core's \`test/functional/[^\`]*\`" \
            -- 'tests/integration/*_bitcoind_test.py' \
        | sed -E 's/.*functional\/([^`]*)`/\1/' | sort -u \
        | while read -r f; do
            git -C <core> ls-tree origin/master test/functional/data/ \
                | awk '$2 == "blob" {print $4}' \
                | grep -v -E '/(__init__\.py|README\.md)$' \
                | while read -r d; do
                    n=$(basename "${d%.*}")
                    if git -C <core> show "origin/master:test/functional/$f" \
                            | grep -q -w -- "$n"; then
                        echo "$f ${d#test/functional/}"
                    fi
                done
        done

A path has moved since the pin where its last commit on `master` is
neither the pin itself nor in the pin's own history, which
`repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/<pin>...<commit>` answers as its `status`.
Committer dates do not answer it: a commit dated before the pin can land
on `master` after it, through a merge the pin's history does not hold.

This script opens no issue. Per master-only failure it reaches the
network once for the Core test file and once for each data file it
loads, for that path's last commit on `master`
(`repos/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits`, `check_vendored_vectors.py`'s own
`_latest_commit` in miniature), and once more for each path whose last
commit is not the pin, for the comparison -- everything else is read
from the two JUnit reports and from `TF2.md` on disk. What it prints is
the whole report: the workflow step redirects it into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`
rather than this script writing there itself, matching neither of the
two scripts beside it needing to know the runner is there at all.
