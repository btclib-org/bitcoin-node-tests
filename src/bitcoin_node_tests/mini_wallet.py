"""`MiniWallet`: coins without a wallet, cached from blocks it mines itself.

[ISS 4](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/4), step 5
of [ISS btclib-org/btclib#2220](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/issues/2220):
Core's own `MiniWallet` (`test/functional/test_framework/wallet.py`) feeds
its own cache by calling `generatetodescriptor` and then `scantxoutset` --
mining through the node's descriptor-wallet machinery and asking the node
to find its own coins back. This one needs neither RPC: `generate` builds
the coinbase itself (`btclib.block.build.build_coinbase`), mines it
(`btclib.block.mining.mine`) and delivers it over `submitblock`, so the
txid and the vout its own coin sits at are known before the block is ever
submitted rather than scanned back out of the node afterwards.

The scriptPubKey every coin of this class pays is Core's own default
`MiniWalletMode.ADDRESS_OP_TRUE` (`wallet.py`'s own docstring table): a
P2TR output whose internal key is the x-only integer 1 and whose single
tapscript leaf, at leaf version `0xc0`, is bare `OP_TRUE` -- the same
pair `test_framework/address.py`'s own
`create_deterministic_address_bcrt1_p2tr_op_true` and
`test_framework/script.py`'s own `taproot_construct` build.
`btclib.script.taproot.output_pubkey` and
`input_script_sig` build the same output key and the same control block
from that pair, byte for byte: the address this module's own scriptPubKey
serializes to under `regtest` is Core's own published constant,
`bcrt1p9yfmy5h72durp7zrhlw9lf7jpwjgvwdg0jr0lqmmjtgg83266lqsekaqka`, and
the spend it proves is standard under bitcoind's default mempool policy,
needing neither a scriptSig long enough to clear a minimum size nor a
policy flag to admit a scriptPubKey no standard template matches. `OP_TRUE`
alone is still the smaller claim than a real signature (`RAW_P2PK`,
`wallet.py`'s third mode): it proves the mechanism this issue is about --
a cache fed from mined blocks -- without also proving btclib's own
signing surface, which every other module of this suite already leaves to
btclib's own test suite (rule 7,
[ISS btclib-org/btclib#2220](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/issues/2220)).

`Capability.MINE` is what a caller checks before constructing one, the
same capability the first family already skips on for a node not
mining: not a new one, since this class produces the fact `MINE` already
names -- "a block the node accepts as its own new tip, however it gets
there" -- by client-side construction over `submitblock` rather than a
node's own wallet, exactly the second half `node.py`'s own docstring
already draws. `BtclibNodeAdapter` declares it only on a build that
connects a submitted block with no peer, and its own `mine` is this
class's `generate` (`btclib_node.py`'s own docstring has both).

[ISS 4](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/4)'s own
remaining ports add several things beyond the mechanism above. Two are
read off Core's own `wallet.py` rather than invented: `get_utxo` finds a
specific cached coin by its own txid, with no maturity filter -- a caller
naming one by hand is presumed to know what it is asking for,
`mempool_spend_coinbase.py`'s own subject being what a *node* does with an
immature one; `create_self_transfer` and `send_self_transfer` both take an
optional `utxo_to_spend`, spending the named coin in place of the one
`get_utxo` would pick. The other two have no counterpart there.
`resync` re-reads this wallet's own tip, height and median-time the way
`__init__` does, for a chain an `invalidateblock` or a `build_fork`
submission moved without this wallet's own `generate` doing it.
`rescan_utxos` (`wallet.py`) is the shape not taken: it also rebuilds the
coin cache from `scantxoutset`, which this module's own docstring already
has why nothing here ever calls; `resync` leaves the cache's membership
for the caller to reconcile against whatever the RPC that exposed the
reorg already told it.

A cached coin's own `height` is the fact `confirmed_only` filters on,
`get_utxo`'s and `get_utxos`' alike (`wallet.py`): the block that holds
it, or `0` for a coin no block holds as far as this wallet knows.
`wallet.py` keeps a separate `confirmations` beside a height that is `0`
exactly when that count is, and filters on the count being positive;
`Utxo.confirmed` is that same test read off the height. `generate` sets
it for the coins it caches, those paying this wallet among the outputs
of a transaction its own `confirm` carries included. A block mined
anywhere else -- by another node, or by `generatetoaddress` on this one,
each filling it from a mempool -- confirms a coin this wallet cannot see
from here, so `resync` also asks the node: `gettxout` with
`include_mempool` false, for every cached coin that is not a coinbase,
`rescan_utxos`' own role in the one respect a `confirmed_only` caller
needs. `gettxout` rather than `getrawtransaction`: it answers from the
chainstate's own UTXO set, where `getrawtransaction` finds a transaction
outside the mempool only with `-txindex` or its block's hash, neither of
which this wallet has.

`generate`'s own `confirm` is the second: no Core file has it, because
Core's own node-side mining (`generatetodescriptor`) pulls the whole
mempool into whatever it mines, and this class's mining reads no mempool
back to do the same (this module's own docstring already has why). A
caller that broadcast a transaction and wants it mined names it here,
already knowing it -- `send_self_transfer`'s own return value, typically
-- rather than this class fetching `getrawmempool` and
`getrawtransaction` back to rediscover what it already handed the node.

`build_fork`, alongside the class, is `create_empty_fork`
(`test/functional/test_framework/blocktools.py`): unsubmitted blocks
extending whatever tip the node it is given actually has, for a caller
that wants to hold them back and submit them later, `mempool_resurrect.py`'s
own subject. It shares no wallet state -- a fork is disposable by
construction, spent by nobody -- so it reads the node fresh rather than a
`MiniWallet` instance's own cache, and pays whichever `script_pub_key` its
caller names, that caller's own wallet's `script_pub_key` ordinarily.

[ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)'s
own `mempool_package_limits.py` and `mempool_updatefromblock.py` need a
coin cache several transactions deep rather than one spend at a time:
`create_self_transfer_multi` spends one or several cached coins into
several outputs at once, Core's own `create_self_transfer_multi`
(`wallet.py`), and `create_self_transfer_chain` spends the output each
call just created into the next, Core's own `create_self_transfer_chain`.
Both, and `create_self_transfer` alongside them, take an optional
`target_vsize`: an `OP_RETURN` output of literal `OP_1` opcodes (no
`PUSHDATA` of its own to size around) pads the transaction to exactly
that many virtual bytes, `_pad_to_vsize` mirroring Core's own `bulk_vout`
(`test_framework/script_util.py`) byte for byte. `get_utxo` gains a
`vout` beside `txid` for the same reason Core's own carries one: a
multi-output call caches more than one coin under the same `txid`, and a
caller spending them in an order its own loop chooses rather than the
order they were cached needs the pair rather than the first match alone.

[ISS 103](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/103):
an RBF or TRUC test's subject is the fee, the sequence or the version, so
the self-transfers take what Core's own take -- `fee_rate`, `fee`,
`version`, `locktime` and `sequence` on `create_self_transfer`, the last
three on `create_self_transfer_multi` -- with Core's own defaults and fee
arithmetic. Where Core's own take BTC `Decimal`s these take satoshis, and
satoshis per 1000 virtual bytes for a rate: the unit `fee_per_output`
already has in Core, and `create_self_transfer`'s own docstring has what
else differs.
