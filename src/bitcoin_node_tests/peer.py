"""`Peer`: the p2p connection a test drives, over `btclib.p2p`'s codecs.

Rule 5 of [ISS 2220](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/issues/2220):
btclib's own `tests/integration/` fixture is not shared, and this is tf2's
own peer rather than a port of Core's `P2PInterface`
(`test/functional/test_framework/p2p.py`) -- a synchronous socket and a
receive loop over `btclib.p2p.Message`, `Version` and the rest, where
Core's own class is `asyncio.Protocol` driven from a background thread.
What is read from Core's own class, rather than copied, is the shape of
the handshake and the convenience a test wants: `handshake` sends and
waits for both sides' `version`/`verack`, and `wait_for` is `wait_until`
narrowed to "the next message of this command", auto-answering a `ping`
along the way so a caller waiting on anything else is not the one that
has to remember to.

`Listener` is the other direction, Core's `peer_accept_connection`: a
socket the node is made to dial, the node's own outbound connection
arriving there as a `Peer` like any other.

A connection speaks the v1 wire unless it is asked for BIP324's v2
transport, Core's `supports_v2_p2p`. The handshake is Core's
`EncryptedP2PState` (`test/functional/test_framework/v2_p2p.py`), the
dialling side as the initiator and the accepting side as the responder.
Its ciphers, its key schedule and its packets are
`btclib.p2p.bip324`'s, its key exchange `btclib.ecc.ellswift`'s.

    - `accept` returns the next queued connection as a `Peer` whose
      `handshake` waits for the node's `version` before sending its own,
