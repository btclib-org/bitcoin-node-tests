"""What CHANGELOG.md must not say about itself.

A count of its own entries is the one fact in the file nothing derives:
prose can be reviewed, a number is right or wrong invisibly. Checking
the number against the entries would make it a line every open branch
has to edit, so the file states none, and this module fails on a count.

RELEASE_NOTES.md is not read here: section 2 of the organization
standard gives it to a repository that publishes, and this tree is
tier 2, owing no release yet (CONTRIBUTING.md's *A version, and no
release*).

A test rather than a reading because `.gitattributes` marks the file
`merge=union`: the driver never conflicts, so a branch carrying a count
paragraph restores it on a rebase with nothing in the merge output to
say so.
