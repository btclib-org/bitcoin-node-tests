"""What the whole suite shares: a hypothesis profile, a coverage gate.

The gate is `coverage_fail_under` and the guard on it. coverage looks
for its configuration in the directory the process started in, so a run
started from `tests/` finds no `fail_under`, no `source` and no
`branch = true`. Section 8 of the organization standard leaves a tree to
point such a run at its configuration or to make it say it is ungated,
and this file is the second of the two: such a run is refused
(btclib-org/.github#443).

`stop_all`, `stash_or_report`, `fold_worker_tally` and `AdapterFactory`
are what `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own hooks and fixtures call:
`[tool.coverage.run]`'s `omit` excludes that whole module, so their
bodies live here, in the one other file the "python tests naming" hook
lets sit beside `*_test.py` files without being one itself, and are
measured by an ordinary run (issue bitcoin-node-tests#101).
