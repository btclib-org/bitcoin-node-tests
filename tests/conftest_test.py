"""Tests for the coverage gate and the guard on it.

`coverage_fail_under` is a property of the command line no run of that
command line can report on itself: the run that reaches it with a subset
selected is, by construction, not the run that measures this file. The
position of `--cov` in addopts is here for the same reason.

The guard beside it is driven the same way, with one exception: the run
it refuses cannot be the run reporting on it either, so the case it
exists for is taken in a subprocess started from `tests/`.

`stop_all`, `stash_or_report` and `fold_worker_tally` below need neither
a subprocess nor a real xdist session: each takes a plain sequence or
mapping rather than the pytest or xdist object it is read off of, so a
test drives it directly (issue bitcoin-node-tests#101). `AdapterFactory`
needs no node either: an adapter it constructs is never started.
