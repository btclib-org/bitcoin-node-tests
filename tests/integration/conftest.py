"""What the integration tests need, and what makes them skip.

Two switches per node, and `TF2_INTEGRATION` gates both: these tests
start a real process, open a real socket and write to disk, none of
which an ordinary `uv run pytest` should do to somebody who asked for
the unit suite. The second switch is the node itself -- found on `PATH`
or named for bitcoind, importable by the named interpreter for
btclib-node -- because an opt-in that fails for a missing program would
report a defect that is not one.

Read from btclib's own `tests/integration/conftest.py` for shape, not
shared with it: this repository's own `NodeAdapter` subclasses are what
start and stop a node here (rule 5 of issue btclib-org/btclib#2220 --
tf2 writes its own adapter), where btclib's fixture spawns `bitcoind` by
hand, having no adapter of its own to reach for.

    TF2_INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest tests/integration

`--tracerpc` and `--timeout-factor` are Core's own `test_framework.py`
options, restated as pytest ones -- CONTRIBUTING.md's own *Running
against a Core developer's own build* has the full mapping, and
`--nocleanup`, `--v2transport` and `--v1transport` are named there too,
neither needing a flag of its own here.

A Core test converged onto both nodes is one body
([ISS 125](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/125)):
a function in `<file>_test.py`, named for Core's own file
(`p2p_block_sync_test.py`), taking the adapters it runs on and
`skip_counts`. Its name carries no `test_` prefix, so pytest collects no
test from that module. `<file>_bitcoind_test.py` and
`<file>_btclib_node_test.py` each call it from a test of the same name
with the prefix, handing it their own node's fixture --
`bitcoind_adapter` or `btclib_node_adapter` for one node,
`bitcoind_cluster` or `btclib_node_cluster` for several. The body asks
`require` of the instances it was handed, never of an adapter class:
`BtclibNodeAdapter.__init__` widens an instance's `capabilities` by
probing the build it runs. A body that writes into its node's data
directory, or starts it on a chain other than regtest or with an option
from its first start, takes `make_adapter`, the adapter class, the
node's executable fixture (`bitcoind_path` or `btclib_node_python`) and
`tmp_path` instead, and `skip_counts` where it asks for a capability: it
builds the node itself over a data directory in `tmp_path`, asks
`require` of that instance, and stops the node before it returns
(`feature_includeconf_test.py`). The two test modules
stay two, rather than one parametrized over both nodes, because the CI
jobs select a node's tests by module: `node-integration.yml`'s
`btclib-node` jobs run `*_btclib_node_test.py`, and its `core-master`
job `*_bitcoind_test.py`.
