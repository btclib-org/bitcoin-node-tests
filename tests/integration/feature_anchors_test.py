"""Core's `feature_anchors`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_anchors.py` (`ddf033054ff6`,
2026-09-11): a node stopped cleanly writes the addresses of its
block-relay-only outbound peers, and no other, to `anchors.dat` in its
chain directory, reads the file back on the next start, deletes it, and
dials the addresses it held.

Each of Core's checks is a body over a fresh node:

- block-relay-only peers the node dials (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`)
  are in the file its stop writes, and inbound peers are not; a file
  one octet longer than the node wrote is read as no anchor at all,
  logged as Core logs it, and deleted all the same.
- an address of a network `addr` cannot carry, a Tor v3 one the node
  dials through a `Socks5Proxy` given as `-onion`
  (`Capability.PROXY`), is written in BIP155's encoding with no service
  flag, and is dialled on the next start once the file names a peer
  offering the services the node asks for.

Core's steps for bitcoin/bitcoin#34213 are in those two bodies: the anchors
survive a network switched off. A node stopped after `setnetworkactive`
false still writes the block-relay-only peers it held; one started with
`-networkactive=0` neither tries nor deletes the file; the anchors are tried
once the network is switched on; and anchors never tried are discarded at
the next shutdown with the network active. They ask for
`Capability.SUSPEND_NETWORK` besides. No release carries the change, so
they run on a build whose `getnetworkinfo` `version` is `329900` or
later. A `master` build from `32.99`'s move (`f3fec67c3e`, 2026-09-11) to
the merge of that change (`802eb7daa9`, 2026-10-02) reports `329900`
without it, and fails them. Core's `-seednode` given twice, an address
nothing listens on (`Capability.ADDRESS_FETCH`), and a clock moved past
the seednode retry timer (`Capability.CLOCK`), both asked for there, show
the node has passed its connection loop with the network off.

Every log line is one Core's own file asserts, over `Capability.DEBUG_LOG`.

Core runs both checks over one node, the second after the file the first
leaves is deleted; here the second starts with `-onion` from its first
start rather than restarting into it. Each line is awaited over
`assert_debug_log`'s own default wait, where Core reads its log once the
block exits, or for two seconds for the last line.
`anchors.dat` is read at `datadir / "regtest"`, Core's `chain_path`, as
`feature_blocksxor_test.py` reads the block files beside it.

`feature_anchors_bitcoind_test.py` and `feature_anchors_btclib_node_test.py`
run each body, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring
having how.
