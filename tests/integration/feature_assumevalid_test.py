"""Core's `feature_assumevalid`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_assumevalid.py` (`fa16bc53d79c`,
2026-04-16), an option and the log
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)): a
chain carries a coinbase output spent, once it matures, by a transaction
with an empty (invalid) signature, and that spend is buried under a
further stretch of blocks reaching past two weeks' worth of work.
`-assumevalid=<hash>`, named at the spending block (`Capability.ASSUME_VALID`),
lets a node skip script verification under that block, so the spend's own
invalid signature is never checked -- the log names which block starts and
which ends the skip, and why (`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`).

Six nodes, each fresh:

- the first, given no `-assumevalid`, verifies every block: the spend is
  caught, the peer sending it is dropped, and the chain's tip past the
  spend is reported invalid (`Capability.CHAIN_TIPS`);
- the second, given the option, skips verification up to and including
  the spending block and takes the whole chain;
- the third, given the option but fed only part of the chain's headers,
  is not yet buried deep enough for the skip and rejects the spend the
  same way the first node does;
- the fourth is fed a competing, higher-work header chain from genesis
  ahead of the real one, so the real chain's first block is not on its
  best header chain, is verified in full, and is accepted regardless,
  carrying no spend of its own;
- the fifth is fed a block at the same height outside the assumevalid
  chain entirely, verified in full and accepted the same way;
- the sixth is restarted under `-reindex-chainstate`, once naming a hash
  not among its headers and once naming the real hash under a chain-work
  floor it cannot meet, hitting each gate without a header-download race.

What differs from Core's file:

- every node starts without its own option, the four that need
  `-assumevalid` restarted with it once the chain's own hash is known,
  as other ports of this harness restart a node rather than starting it
  configured from the first start;
- each block is built with btclib in the shape of Core's own
  `create_block` and `create_coinbase` (`blocktools.py`); the first
  block's coinbase pays a fixed private key's P2PK output rather than a
  fresh one Core's own `generate_keypair` draws each run, and the spend
  is Core's own `create_tx_with_script(block1.vtx[0], 0, script_sig=b"",
  amount=49 * COIN)`;
- block timestamps increase by one second throughout, where Core's own
  file increases its own counter twice in a row once, around the
  spending block -- harmless to a chain that only needs strictly
  increasing timestamps;
- Core's own `p2p0`/`p2p1`/... are named after the node each is
  connected to instead;
- the log lines a node's own action is checked against are read
  per-build off `getnetworkinfo`'s `version`, through constants each
  naming its own merge and release: a script-verification toggle logs
  nothing at all before `v30.0`, logs the older wording from there
  through `v30.x`, and from `v31.0` on names the reason too
  (`bitcoin/bitcoin#32975`, then `bitcoin/bitcoin#33336`); the
  rejection's own line names it `block-script-verify-flag-failed` only
  from `v30.0` on, `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed` below that
  (`bitcoin/bitcoin#33183`) -- a rename unrelated to the other two.
  Every acceptance, rejection and disconnect this test checks for still
  holds on a `v29.4` or a `v30.3` build, only the log read against it
  differs, or is left unread where the build logs none.

`feature_assumevalid_bitcoind_test.py` and
`feature_assumevalid_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
