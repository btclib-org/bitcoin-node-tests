"""Core's `feature_block`, as bodies over each node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_block.py`: a node is fed a
sequence of valid and invalid blocks, forks and re-orgs, over one peer,
and each block's verdict is checked. `bitcoin_node_tests.feature_block`
builds that sequence as data, and its module docstring says what the
sequence leaves out of Core's file. Each body here feeds the whole
sequence to a fresh node over p2p, the way Core's `P2PDataStore` does.

A block is announced by its header, and the peer answers each `getdata`
with the blocks it has sent on that connection, until one names the
block announced; a block the node has no reason to ask for is sent
unasked. Then the body waits for the node to drop the peer where Core
does, and otherwise for a `ping` round trip, and reads the tip off
`getbestblockhash`. A new connection follows each drop, and the block
sent in a non-canonical encoding is followed by one too, as in Core's
run. Each new connection waits for the node's `getheaders`, as Core's
`bootstrap_p2p` does. The
other steps go over RPC: `invalidateblock`, `setmocktime`,
`getrawmempool` and `gettxout`.

The log half asserts besides each refused block's reason in the node's
own log, as Core's `send_blocks_and_test` does (`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`).

Each body asks for `Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`, for the BIP34
height the sequence's first block needs, `Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`,
`Capability.CLOCK` and `Capability.PEER_TIMEOUT`.

What differs from Core's file, beyond what the sequence leaves out:

- Core's harness starts every node with a `peertimeout` (`write_config`,
  `test_framework/util.py`); here the node is restarted with it, so that
  `CConnman::InactivityCheck` (`src/net.cpp`) does not drop the peer
  once the node's clock is two hours ahead;
- Core starts its node with `-prevoutfetchthreads=8` besides, an option
  of Core's block validation that a bitcoind before `v32.0` refuses as an
  invalid parameter.

Each `feature_block_<node>_test.py` module beside this one runs each
body, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
