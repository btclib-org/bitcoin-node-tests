"""Core's `feature_chain_tiebreaks`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_chain_tiebreaks.py`
(`20ae9b98eab2`, 2026-03-04), a file needing no mechanism the adapter
lacks ([ISS 317](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/317)):
of the blocks of equal work a node holds, it takes as its tip the one
whose chain it held in full first, and keeps that tip across a restart.
The nodes start unlinked on a clean chain, each fed blocks by a peer.

In Core's own labels, the first node takes `B0` on genesis, then the
headers of `B1` and `B2` on it over `submitheader`, and `B2`'s block
before `B1`'s: `B2` is the tip. Given the headers of `B3` to `B6`, on
`B1` and `B2`, and of `B7` to `B10`, on `B3` and `B4`, the tip stays;
given the blocks of `B7` to `B10`, whose parents' blocks it lacks, it
stays too. Given `B4`'s block and then `B3`'s, the node takes `B9`
rather than `B7`, which it received first: `B9`'s chain was complete
before `B7`'s, and `B9` arrived before `B10`, its sibling. Invalidating
`B9` and `B10` (`Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`) takes the node to `B7`.

The second node mines a block (`Capability.GENERATE`) and is handed
`A1`, `A2` and `A3` on it, of equal work: `A1` is the tip. Restarted,
the node keeps `A1` as its tip, and takes a block built on it.

What differs from Core's file:

- each block is built with btclib in the shape of Core's own
  `create_block` (`blocktools.py`), its coinbase paying `OP_TRUE`;
- Core's `P2PDataStore` answers every `getdata` naming a block it
  holds; here the peer waits for the `getdata` naming the block it
  announced and sends that block, which is what `send_blocks_and_test`
  waits for before its own `ping` round trip;
- the check that the node keeps its tip across the restart runs where
  the running build's `getnetworkinfo` `version` is `v31.0` or later,
  the first release carrying Core's change (bitcoin/bitcoin#29640) and
  the first carrying Core's file. A release before it, `v29.4` and
  `v30.3` among them, breaks a tie between blocks it loaded from disk
  on the address each sits at in memory, as its own
  `CBlockIndexWorkComparator` (`src/node/blockstorage.cpp`) says, so a
  restart can leave `A2` or `A3` its tip. The threshold leaves the
  check out for a `master` build reporting `30.99` taken after the
  change's merge, bitcoin/bitcoin@56e9703968e26353fd4663e07a7bba198a272d12.

Every step is the same at `v31.1`, the release `bitcoind.py` pins, whose
copy of the file is the pin's.

`feature_chain_tiebreaks_bitcoind_test.py` and
`feature_chain_tiebreaks_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
