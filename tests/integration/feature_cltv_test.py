"""Core's `feature_cltv`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_cltv.py` (`fab352053d6e`,
2026-04-16), on the option and MiniWallet families together
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
`-testactivationheight=cltv@N` (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`)
holds BIP65 inactive until a chosen height, and blocks built and
submitted here (`Capability.MINE`) reach it.

Kept: `getdeploymentinfo`'s own `bip65` entry, transitioning one block
before the configured height, and the buried-deployment version floor a
version-3 block trips once BIP65 is active -- `bad-version(0x00000003)`,
`submitblock`'s own answer and, in a body of its own, bitcoind's own
debug log line. That check is isolated from the other buried
deployments' own default floors, unlike `feature_dersig`'s: a version-3
block already satisfies BIP66's own default floor (active from height 1
regardless of `-testactivationheight=cltv@N`), so version 3 is refused
only once the configured height is reached, and Core's own file checks
exactly this version.

BIP65's failure reasons are kept too
([ISS 167](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/167)).
They need no signature: Core's coins are its `RAW_OP_TRUE` ones,
coinbases paying a bare `OP_TRUE` and spent with a scriptSig of
`OP_NOP`s alone, and `_cltv_invalidate` prepends to that scriptSig what
fails `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` for one reason, `_cltv_validate` what
passes it. Each body asks only for what it needs:

- before the configured height, a block carrying the invalid spends
  is accepted, and at it a block carrying any of them is refused in
  Core's wording, at Core's own height so that the coinbases have
  matured -- the boundary where the script rule starts;
- once BIP65 is active, `testmempoolaccept` refuses each for its own
  reason, in Core's wording. Without Core's own `-acceptnonstdtxn=1`
  (`Capability.ACCEPT_NON_STANDARD`) bitcoind refuses each as
  `scriptsig-not-pushonly` before any script runs, so the node is
  restarted with it;
- once BIP65 is active, `submitblock` refuses a block carrying each, in
  Core's wording, and accepts one carrying the spend CLTV admits. Core
  reads that refusal from the debug log; `submitblock`'s answer carries
  the same reason.

The mempool and block refusals run on regtest's own default, BIP65
active from height 1 (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`'s own
docstring), where Core runs them at its configured height: neither asks
for `-testactivationheight`, so neither is gated on it, and the first
body is what pins the height the rule starts at.

`feature_cltv_bitcoind_test.py` and `feature_cltv_btclib_node_test.py`
run these, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
