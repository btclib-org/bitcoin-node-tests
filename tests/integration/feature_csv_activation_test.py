"""Core's `feature_csv_activation`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_csv_activation.py`
(`fab352053d6e`, 2026-04-16), on the option and MiniWallet families together
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
`-testactivationheight=csv@N` (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`)
holds BIP68, BIP112 and BIP113 -- one deployment, `csv` -- inactive until
a chosen height, and blocks built and submitted here (`Capability.MINE`)
reach it.

Kept: `getdeploymentinfo`'s own `csv` entry, transitioning one block
before the configured height. CSV carries no buried-deployment version
floor of its own -- `src/validation.cpp`'s own
`ContextualCheckBlockHeader` reads only `DEPLOYMENT_HEIGHTINCB`,
`DEPLOYMENT_DERSIG` and `DEPLOYMENT_CLTV` for its version check -- so,
unlike its two siblings, this file has no version-floor refusal to
observe on the wire or in the log.

Core's own body is kept too, step by step and at Core's own heights
([ISS 167](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/167)).
Coinbases pay `mini_wallet.py`'s `RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY`, Core's
`RAW_P2PK` output, and `raw_p2pk_script_sig` signs every spend; a
BIP112 spend then has `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`, and the argument it
checks where there is one, prepended to that scriptSig, as Core's does.
Each spend goes to a block of its own or with others, and the block is
accepted or refused in Core's wording:

- in the block before the configured height every spend is accepted,
  version 1 and version 2 alike, and at that height BIP113 refuses a
  lock time equal to the median time past, which pins where BIP113
  starts; BIP68's and BIP112's refusals follow a few blocks on, as in
  Core's own file;
- BIP68's relative lock times are refused until the input is deep
  enough, by height or by time, and a version-1 spend never is;
- BIP112's `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` refuses a negative argument, an
  empty stack, and an argument the input's own nSequence does not
  satisfy.

Where Core delivers a block over p2p and reads a refusal from the debug
log, this submits it and reads `submitblock`'s answer, which carries the
same reason. Core timestamps its blocks by hand, ten minutes apart and
far enough in the past for the chain to stay behind the node's clock,
and has the node mine under `setmocktime` twice: the coinbases, before
the first of those, and the block confirming the inputs, ten minutes
after the last. Both are built here instead, timestamped in those same
places, so no `Capability.CLOCK` is asked for. After each accepted block
Core's `invalidateblock` (`Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`) takes it back
off, so the next check builds on the same tip.

`feature_csv_activation_bitcoind_test.py` and
`feature_csv_activation_btclib_node_test.py` run these,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
