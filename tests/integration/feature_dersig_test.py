"""Core's `feature_dersig`, one body per test over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_dersig.py` (`fab352053d6e`,
2026-04-16), on the option and MiniWallet families together
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
`-testactivationheight=dersig@N` (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`)
holds BIP66 inactive until a chosen height, and `MiniWallet.generate`
(`Capability.MINE`) mines to it with no node wallet.

Core's own closing checks are kept too, in a body of their own
([ISS 167](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/167)):
a spend whose signature is not strict DER is mined in the block before
BIP66 activates, and from the configured height on is refused by
`testmempoolaccept` and `submitblock`, each in Core's own wording, while
the same spend DER-encoded is accepted. That needs a real ECDSA spend,
which `MiniWallet`'s own `ADDRESS_OP_TRUE` coins do not carry: its
coins are coinbases paying `RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY`, Core's own
`RAW_P2PK` output, spent under `raw_p2pk_script_sig` (`mini_wallet.py`),
at Core's own height so that they have matured. Dropped from it is the
debug-log wording of the block refusal, which `submitblock`'s own answer
already carries.

Kept, and read at the pinned bitcoind `31.1` rather than assumed:
`getdeploymentinfo`'s own `bip66` entry, which transitions from inactive
to active one block before the configured height -- the same "not
active as of current tip, but the next block must obey rules" boundary
Core's own file comments -- and the buried-deployment version floor
Core's own file also checks with a version-2 block once BIP66 is
active, `bad-version(0x00000002)` both in `submitblock`'s own answer and
in the node's own debug log (`ProcessNewBlock: AcceptBlock FAILED
(bad-version(0x00000002), ...)`, `src/validation.cpp`'s own
`ContextualCheckBlockHeader`). Not narrowed further than Core's own
file on this specific check: measured live against the pinned `31.1`,
a version-2 block is refused the same way both before and after BIP66's
own configured height, BIP65's own default floor (`-testactivationheight`
touching only the deployment it names) already requiring version 4 from
height 1 -- so Core's own file does not attempt the before/after
comparison for this check either, only the after-activation refusal.

`feature_dersig_bitcoind_test.py` and `feature_dersig_btclib_node_test.py`
run each body, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring
having how.
