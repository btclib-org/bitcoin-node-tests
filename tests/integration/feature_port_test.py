"""Core's `feature_port`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_port.py`
(`997757dd2b4d`, 2024-11-15), the option and log families together
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
where a node restarted with `-port` and `-bind`
(`Capability.LISTEN_ADDRESS`) listens, read off the `Bound to` lines its
debug log (`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`) gains, and the error a `-port` of
`65536` or `0` stops its start with. Every check of Core's is kept, in
its order.

Core keeps its framework's own `-bind` entries off the node:
`bind_to_localhost_only`'s `bind=127.0.0.1` and the pair
`TestNode.start` adds wherever no `-bind` is given
(`test_framework/test_node.py`). An adapter's own `_command` may name
one too, so the node is built from the class the caller passes,
`feature_port_bitcoind_test.py`'s own subclass for bitcoind. Every start
names a `-port`, so the node never listens at its chain's default port.

Core's ports come from `p2p_port`, and the port after each is used
unprobed. Here each port comes from `free_ports` together with the port
after it, both probed.

A refused start compares the node's stderr with Core's `expected_msg`
whole, the `ErrorMatch.FULL_TEXT` comparison
`assert_start_raises_init_error` makes by default.

`feature_port_bitcoind_test.py` and `feature_port_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
