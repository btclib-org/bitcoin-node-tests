"""Core's `feature_presegwit_node_upgrade`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_presegwit_node_upgrade.py`
(`fad7bd9ba3eef03fcdd7cb17011ea0c6e483c767`, 2026-01-14) and ported,
an option-family test
([ISS 3](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/3)):
`-testactivationheight=segwit@N` (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`)
holds segwit inactive until a chosen height, blocks are mined below it
over `submitblock` (`Capability.MINE`), and the node is then restarted
with a lower height its chain already runs past. The node starts without
the option and is restarted with Core's own first height before any
block is mined.

Every assertion of Core's own file is kept: a fresh chain with segwit
inactive; the mined height; the restart refused, its exit code non-zero
and its whole stderr equal to Core's own `expected_msg` -- Core's own
`ErrorMatch.FULL_TEXT`, the default `assert_start_raises_init_error`
applies; and, restarted with `-reindex` added, a chain one block short of
the lower height with segwit active. Dropped is the empty stderr Core's
own `TestNode.stop_node` expects of every stop: a check its harness makes
around each stop rather than one this file makes, and `NodeAdapter.stop`
makes it for no test.

The blocks are mined in the shape Core's own `generate` gives them rather
than `MiniWallet.generate`'s: a coinbase carrying the witness commitment
and no witness nonce. `GenerateCoinbaseCommitment` (`src/validation.cpp`)
writes the commitment into every block `CreateNewBlock`
(`src/node/miner.cpp`) assembles, and its own
`UpdateUncommittedBlockStructures` adds the nonce only once segwit is
active, so every block Core's own file mines carries the one without the
other. Under segwit's rules `CheckWitnessMalleation` refuses that pair
(`bad-witness-nonce-size`), which is what stops the reindexed chain one
block short of the lower height. A `MiniWallet` block carries neither,
and a block committing to no witness and carrying none is valid either
side of activation: measured against the pinned bitcoind `31.1`, a chain
of them reindexes to its full mined height instead.

`NodeAdapter.start` (`node.py`) waits for the RPC to answer and no
longer, where Core's own `TestNode.wait_for_rpc_connection` also waits
for `getmempoolinfo`'s `loaded`, which the import thread of
`src/init.cpp` sets only once `ImportBlocks` has returned: this body
waits for it after the reindexing start, the one start here after which
a height it reads could still be moved by a running import.

`feature_presegwit_node_upgrade_bitcoind_test.py` and
`feature_presegwit_node_upgrade_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
