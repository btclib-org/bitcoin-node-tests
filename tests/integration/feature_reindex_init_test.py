"""Core's `feature_reindex_init`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/feature_reindex_init.py`
(`0d1301b47a35`, 2026-03-24), the option and disk families together
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
a node stopped and its block index removed from `blocks/index` refuses
to start, advising a reindex in Core's own words, and started again
with `-test=reindex_after_failure_noninteractive_yes`
(`Capability.REINDEX_AFTER_FAILURE`) reindexes from its block files
back to the height it had. `blocks/` is Core's own layout
(`Capability.BLK_FILES`), under the regtest chain's own directory, the
chain every node of this suite starts on by default.

Core's own claim in full but for the refusal's stderr, read per-build
below. Its chain is the framework's cached one; this
node mines its own to the same height (`Capability.MINE`). The node is
built over a data directory of its own, through `make_adapter`
(`tests/integration/conftest.py`), since the test removes a directory
inside it. Core's harness waits, after a start, for `getmempoolinfo`'s
`loaded`, "for the node to finish reindex, block import, and loading the
mempool" (`TestNode.wait_for_rpc_connection`'s own comment), where
`NodeAdapter.start` returns on the first RPC answer. This waits the same
way before reading the height: without the wait, `getblockcount` answered
`0` right after the start, measured against the pinned release.

A bitcoind before `v31.0` prints `": "` ahead of that message, `noui`
having added the empty caption and its separator
(bitcoin/bitcoin#34276). No probe tells the two apart, the node having no
option or RPC for it: that build is asserted to print it, read off its own
`getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 354](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/354)).

`feature_reindex_init_bitcoind_test.py` and
`feature_reindex_init_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
