"""Core's `p2p_1p1c_network`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_1p1c_network.py` (`95ef0fc5e781`,
2025-12-29, the same file at the pinned `v31.1`): packages submitted to
one node of a line reach every other node over p2p, a parent paying too
little alone relayed with the child paying for it (1p1c), though some of
those nodes were sent part of a package beforehand -- keeping a child as
an orphan, or refusing a parent for its fee.

Core's `run_test` is the body, in its own order, over a line of nodes,
each dialling the one before it as Core's `setup_network` has them, and
every assertion of Core's own is kept:

- a peer of each node but the first sends it part of the packages: the
  second node every child and the first parent of the package of two
  parents, the third that parent alone, the last that parent and the
  parent of every other package. Every node's mempool then holds that
  parent alone, the one paying enough, and the second node keeps the
  children as orphans where no other node keeps any;
- once the peers disconnect, no node keeps an orphan;
- `submitpackage` takes each package on the first node, whose mempool
  then holds every transaction of every package, and every node's
  mempool comes to agree with it.

The packages are Core's own: a parent paying no fee and a child paying
for both, once with a witness and once with none; two parents above the
relay fee and a child of both; and a parent paying no fee into two
outputs, a child spending both.

The orphans are `Capability.ORPHANAGE`'s, asked for first, as the 1p1c
relay of `p2p_opportunistic_1p1c_test.py` asks for it, then
`Capability.PACKAGE_ACCEPTANCE`, for `submitpackage`, then
`Capability.CONNECT` and `Capability.MINE`. Every node restarts with the
`-whitelist=noban,in,out@127.0.0.1` Core's `noban_tx_relay` starts every
node with, which asks for no capability. The final agreement is a relay
across the line, each hop the time a node takes to announce and to ask:
Core's own waits bound it, scaled by `--timeout-factor`.

A bitcoind before `v31.0` refuses a package whose parent pays no fee:
bitcoin/bitcoin#33892, first in `v31.0rc1`, lets the child pay for it.
Core's own `v30.3` file instead starts each node with `-maxmempool=5`
(and `v29.4`'s with `-datacarriersize=100000` beside it, for
`fill_mempool`'s padding), fills the first node's mempool with
`fill_mempool` so that every node's minimum fee rate stands above the
relay fee, and has each parent pay that fee, the parent with two outputs
one satoshi per virtual byte, which the child spending both pays fifty
times over. The mempools then hold the filler too, so that file reads
neither their contents nor the orphanage before the peers leave, and only
waits for the mempools to agree once the packages are submitted. The body
reads the build's `getnetworkinfo` `version` against
`_ZERO_FEE_PARENT_VERSION`, bitcoin/bitcoin#33892 changing no RPC, and
does as that file does before it. A known limit: a `master` build from
that merge (`ec4ff99a22`) up to the move to `31.99` reports a `30.99`
version with the new rule, so the body fails against such a build.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core's second wallet is a `MiniWalletMode.RAW_P2PK` one on the third
  node: here `mine_p2pk_coins` (`p2pk_coins_test.py`) mines, on that
  node, coinbases paying `RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY`, and
  `raw_p2pk_script_sig` (`mini_wallet.py`) signs every spend of one,
  every input signed under btclib's deterministic nonce where Core's
  draws signatures until the scriptSig is of one fixed length;
- Core's `rescan_utxos` reads its wallet's coins off the chain; the
  `MiniWallet` (`mini_wallet.py`) here caches the coins it mines;
- Core's `P2PInterface` asks for whatever the node announces; `Peer`
  (`peer.py`) asks for nothing, the checks reading no announcement;
- Core's `disconnect_p2ps` closes one node's peers and waits for it to
  count no test peer, node by node; here every peer closes, then each
  node waits to count the peers it had before its own connected;
- every fee Core writes in BTC is written here in satoshis, and every
  fee rate in satoshis per 1000 virtual bytes.

`p2p_1p1c_network_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_1p1c_network_btclib_node_test.py` run the body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
