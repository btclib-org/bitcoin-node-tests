"""Core's `p2p_addr_selfannouncement`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_addr_selfannouncement.py`
(`dab7f2c984bd`, 2026-07-07): a node given `-externalip`
(`Capability.EXTERNAL_IP`) advertises that address to a peer once the
connection opens, in an `addr` or `addrv2` message of its own, the first
the peer receives, and again later, each time the clock has moved far
enough.

Core's `self_announcement_test` is run by each body over `addr` and then
over `addrv2`, each body over a fresh node:

- an inbound peer, which sends `getaddr` as Core's `P2PInterface` does,
  receives the self-announcement alone in its first address message and
  the node's answer to its `getaddr` in the second, from the addresses
  the node was given over `addpeeraddress`
  (`Capability.KNOWN_ADDRESSES`);
- an outbound full-relay peer the node dials
  (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`) receives the self-announcement alone;
- each receives one more self-announcement, alone in one more message,
  each time the node's clock (`Capability.CLOCK`) moves twenty days.

Each is a wire half, asserting what the peer receives, and a log half
asserting Core's own `Advertising address` line on each announcement
besides (`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`). A last body is Core's
`test_externalip_bypasses_onlynet`: under `-onlynet=ipv4`
(`Capability.ONLYNET`), an onion `-externalip` is among
`getnetworkinfo`'s `localaddresses`, onion being unreachable.

Core's chain is the framework's cached one, out of initial block
download, before whose end a node advertises no address; here the node
mines one block (`Capability.MINE`) to leave it. The node is restarted with the
`-peertimeout` and `-connect=0` Core's harness gives every node
(`Capability.PEER_TIMEOUT`), so that a clock moved twenty days drops no
peer as inactive and the addresses it is given are dialled by no
automatic connection. Core reuses one node across its checks, resetting
its clock to the wall clock at the start of each.

`-externalip` bypasses `-onlynet` past the pinned release, from
bitcoin/bitcoin@8c87e32bd3937251d6f30295cc1924048e5b74d1, which `v32.0rc1`
is the first tag to carry: a bitcoind whose `getnetworkinfo` `version`
reads older than that
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35))
leaves the onion address out of `localaddresses`, which is asserted
there instead. A `master` build between that change's merge and the
version's move to `32.99` reads older and bypasses all the same, the
constant's own comment having the commits.

Before `v31.0` a bitcoind sends the first self-announcement to an inbound
peer in the same message as its answer to the peer's `getaddr`
(bitcoin/bitcoin#34146).

No probe tells the two behaviours apart, the node having no option or RPC
for it: that build's inbound checks assert the one message, read off its own
`getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 354](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/354)).

`p2p_addr_selfannouncement_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_addr_selfannouncement_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
