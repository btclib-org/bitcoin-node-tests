"""Core's `p2p_compactblocks`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_compactblocks.py` (`28641fd195db`,
2026-07-31): how a node negotiates, builds, serves and takes BIP152's
compact blocks, and which malformed or invalid ones drop the peer
sending them. Each of the checks below is one of Core's `test_*`
methods, a body over a fresh node:

- a node announces new blocks as `cmpctblock` only to a peer whose
  `sendcmpct` asks for it at version 2, and stops once one asks it not
  to, an inbound peer or an outbound one;
- a `cmpctblock` a node announces, or sends for a `getdata`, prefills
  its coinbase and carries every other transaction as the short id
  BIP152 derives from its wtxid;
- a block announced by `inv` or by `headers` is asked for as a compact
  one, and a `blocktxn` carrying what the node asks for completes it;
- a node asks only for the transactions of a `cmpctblock` it has not
  got, and asks for none once its mempool holds them all;
- a node answers a `getblocktxn` for a block near its tip with those
  transactions and one for a deeper block with the whole block, and
  drops a peer asking for an index past the block;
- a block deeper than Core's `MAX_CMPCTBLOCK_DEPTH` is sent whole where
  a compact one is asked for, and a `cmpctblock` for a block off the
  tip leaves only its header;
- a `cmpctblock` whose block has too little work to be kept leaves no
  header behind;
- a `blocktxn` that does not complete the block has the node ask for
  the whole of it;
- a block submitted over RPC is announced as `cmpctblock` to every peer
  asking for it;
- a `cmpctblock` carrying a block that fails validation keeps the peer,
  as does the same one sent again, and one building on that block drops
  it;
- a `getblocktxn` naming no index drops the peer;
- a second `blocktxn` for a block whose reconstruction failed drops the
  peer;
- a `sendcmpct` whose announce octet is neither zero nor one drops the
  peer;
- a `cmpctblock` prefilling an index past its block drops the peer,
  sent unasked by a high-bandwidth peer or asked for from a
  low-bandwidth one;
- a block a peer announces and does not complete is reconstructed from
  another peer's `cmpctblock`, and one whose coinbase witness the block
  does not commit to leaves the first peer's `blocktxn` to complete it;
- a node asks the second peer announcing a block for its transactions,
  and a third only where that one is outbound;
- `getpeerinfo` reports which side has selected the other for
  high-bandwidth mode;
- a node ignores a `cmpctblock` from a peer that has sent no
  `sendcmpct`, and one it did not ask for from a peer it has not
  selected for high-bandwidth mode.

Where Core's check reads the node's log, it is two bodies: a wire half,
asserting what the peer sees, and a log half asserting bitcoind's own
wording beside it (`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`).

Every body but those over a `sendcmpct`'s announce octet and an empty
`getblocktxn` mines its coins first (`Capability.MINE`,
`mini_wallet.MiniWallet`), which also leaves initial block download,
where a node neither asks for compact blocks nor announces them. The
bodies over an outbound peer ask for `Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND` first,
`_BlockConn.outbound` having the node dial a `peer.Listener`. BIP152's
messages are btclib's own `btclib.p2p.compact_blocks`, and `_cmpctblock`
below builds one the way Core's `HeaderAndShortIDs.initialize_from_block`
does at `use_witness=True`.

Core's `TestP2PConn` records what the node sends from its framework's
network thread. Here `_BlockConn`, a `Conn` (`p2p_conns_test.py`), does so
on the test's own thread, where a wait reads the peer's connection: a
wait reads the peer up to the `pong` of a ping round trip ahead of every
poll, and a check that the node sent nothing reads it up to that `pong`
once.

What differs from Core's file besides:

- Core runs every check over one node and its peers, each check starting
  from the chain and the peer state the checks before it left; here each
  body starts a fresh node and builds that state itself. A body whose
  check needs the node to take a `cmpctblock` it did not ask for first
  has its peer send a `sendcmpct` and deliver a block, which makes it a
  high-bandwidth peer, as Core's earlier checks have made it: a node
  carrying bitcoin/bitcoin#32606 ignores such a `cmpctblock` from any
  other peer;
- Core fills its blocks with transactions paying and spending bare
  `OP_TRUE` scripts, which its node takes into the mempool only under the
  `-acceptnonstdtxn=1` it starts with; here `MiniWallet`'s own
  transactions fill them, and the node starts with no option;
- Core runs `test_sendcmpct` over each of its peers, an outbound one
  among them; here it runs over one inbound peer and over one outbound
  one, each a body of its own;
- Core's `test_getblocktxn_handler` reads the blocks its earlier checks
  left; here each block it reads carries a chain of transactions;
- the log line Core's `test_getblocktxn_handler` reads beside the
  disconnect for an index past the block is not asserted;
- Core's `test_invalid_cmpctblock_message` reads `getpeerinfo`'s
  `bip152_hb_to` and `bip152_hb_from` for its two peers; here the
  `sendcmpct` the node sent each is read, and the peer's own request is
  not;
- Core's `test_invalid_tx_in_compactblock` adds the witness commitment
  its transactions do not need before dropping the coinbase's witness;
  here the transactions carry witnesses, so the block already commits to
  them and keeps its header once the coinbase's witness is dropped, and
  the block with an invalid transaction is built anew on the tip, where
  Core edits its own;
- Core's `test_multiple_blocktxn_response` waits after its first
  `blocktxn` for a `getdata` naming the block, which the one its header
  drew already does; here that one is cleared first, so the wait is for
  the node's fallback;
- the log line Core's `test_low_work_compactblocks` reads names its peer
  as `0`; here the id is `getpeerinfo`'s;
- Core's `test_compactblock_reconstruction_stalling_peer` gives the
  coinbase a witness its block carries no commitment for; here the block
  commits to its transactions' witnesses, so the coinbase's witness is
  given a reserved value other than the one the commitment was built
  with, and the stalling peer's `blocktxn` carries the witnesses, where
  Core's transactions have none;
- Core's stalling peer in
  `test_compactblock_reconstruction_parallel_reconstruction` has
  delivered blocks in its earlier checks; here it delivers none, so the
  node never selects it for high-bandwidth mode, and `getpeerinfo`'s
  `bip152_hb_to` is read in the order of the peers' ids rather than in
  the order `getpeerinfo` lists them;
- Core's `test_compact_blocks_ignored` reads its high-bandwidth peer off
  those its earlier checks left; here that peer is made high-bandwidth
  first, in the state Core's own
  `test_highbandwidth_mode_states_via_getpeerinfo` leaves its peer in.

A `sendcmpct` whose announce octet is neither zero nor one drops the
peer past the pinned release, from
bitcoin/bitcoin@2d0dce0af54b8eb0ebdaf62f12a92d7e559a281e, and so does a
`getblocktxn` naming no index, from
bitcoin/bitcoin@28641fd195db2a175fd43fee2e32758aef9816a6. A
`cmpctblock` from a peer that has sent no `sendcmpct`, and one the node
did not ask for from a peer it has not selected for high-bandwidth mode,
are ignored past it, from bitcoin/bitcoin#32606. `v32.0rc1` is the first
tag to carry each. A bitcoind whose `getnetworkinfo` `version` reads
older than that
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35))
keeps the peer, answering the `getblocktxn` with a `blocktxn` carrying
no transaction, and takes each `cmpctblock`, which is asserted there
instead, the log halves reading the node's own lines for the exchange
and no `Misbehaving`. A `master` build between a change's merge and the
version's move to `32.99` reads older and does what the change has it do
all the same, the constants' own comments having the commits.

`p2p_compactblocks_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_compactblocks_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
