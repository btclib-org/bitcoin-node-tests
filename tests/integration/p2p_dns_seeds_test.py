"""Core's `p2p_dns_seeds`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_dns_seeds.py` (`fa4cb96bdec2`,
2026-02-17), a file of
[ISS 47](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/47):
a node given `-connect` asks its chain's DNS seeds for no peers unless
`-dnsseed` says so, refuses `-forcednsseed` beside `-dnsseed` off, skips
the seeds once outbound full-relay peers connect but not block-relay-only
ones, queries them at once under `-forcednsseed`, and waits before
querying for as long as the size of its address table decides. Every
step of Core's `run_test` is kept, in its order, over one node, each
reading Core's own line out of the node's debug log or, for a start
Core expects refused, Core's own wording whole out of its stderr.

The test asks for `Capability.DNS_SEED`, `Capability.KNOWN_ADDRESSES`
for Core's `addpeeraddress` and `getnodeaddresses`, `Capability.PROXY`
for the unreachable proxy, `Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND` for the peers
the node dials and `Capability.DEBUG_LOG`.

No DNS server is involved. Every start but the refused ones is given
Core's `UNREACHABLE_PROXY_ARG` (`test_framework/netutil.py`), a
`-proxy` nothing listens at: under a proxy, a node querying a DNS seed
resolves nothing itself and queues a connection to the seed's name
through that proxy instead (`CConnman::ThreadDNSAddressSeed`,
`src/net.cpp`). The peers the node dials are on loopback, an address
no proxy is used for.

The node is built with Core's own `extra_args` and started with them
from its first start, as Core's `set_test_params` has it, and a restart
naming none goes back to them, as Core's `restart_node(0)` does. Core's
`write_config` (`test_framework/util.py`) also writes `connect=0` into
the node's `bitcoin.conf`, so `-connect=0` joins every start here whose
own arguments name no `-connect`. Its `dnsseed=0` line is not passed:
under it, Core's own run finds `DNS seeding disabled` and the
`-forcednsseed` refusal beside `-connect` whatever `-connect` does, where
here each comes from `-connect`'s own soft-set of `-dnsseed`, the reason
Core's comments give. Its `fixedseeds=0` line bears on no start here,
the node drawing no peer of its own under either `-connect`.

The node starts on a fresh chain, as Core's `setup_clean_chain` has it,
so no cached chain is read. Its ports come from `node.free_ports`, and
each peer it dials listens on a port the OS chooses, where Core derives
each from `p2p_idx`. The peers are closed before the next restart,
where Core's `restart_node` forgets them. Each log wait counts from the
end of its block, as `assert_debug_log` (`debug_log.py`) counts it,
where Core's counts from its start.

Core's `force_dns_test` step also passes with its `-forcednsseed`
removed, here and under Core's own framework alike (measured against
the pinned release): the node already knows an address, so it queries
the seeds after its shorter wait, which ends inside the step's own.

`p2p_dns_seeds_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_dns_seeds_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
