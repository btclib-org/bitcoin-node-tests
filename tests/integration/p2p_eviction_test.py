"""Core's `p2p_eviction`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_eviction.py` (`1b76e0473647`,
2026-07-24), the option and MiniWallet families together
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
once `-maxconnections` leaves no inbound slot for a new peer, the node
evicts an existing inbound one (`Capability.INBOUND_EVICTION`), and never
one of those its eviction logic protects -- here the peers that sent it
a novel block, those that sent it a transaction, and those with the
lowest ping. `MiniWallet` (`Capability.MINE`) funds the transactions and
`build_fork` builds the blocks.

Core's own claim in full: twenty-one inbound peers fill the slots Core's
own arithmetic leaves for transaction-relaying peers, the twenty-second
triggers the eviction, exactly one peer is disconnected, and it is none
of the peers expected to be protected. What fills those slots differs
between builds, and is read from the build (ISS 35): the pinned commit
lets transaction-relaying peers take only half of a node's inbound
slots, where the pinned `31.1` gives every inbound slot to any peer.
`-maxconnections=53` leaves twenty-one transaction-relaying slots under
the split, `-maxconnections=32` twenty-one slots without it, the value
Core's own file carried before `1b76e0473647`, and
`_splits_inbound_slots` below asks the node's own `-help` which of the
two it is -- `-inboundrelaypercent`, whose default keeps the pinned
commit's half, or the pinned commit's own wording of the split. The
node starts without `-maxconnections` and is restarted with the value
the probe picks, Core's own `extra_args` given at a restart.

`Peer` answers a ping only while a caller is reading, where Core's
`P2PInterface` answers from a background thread, so `_sync_with_ping`
below reads for it: it answers the node's first ping, after Core's own
tenth of a second for a slow peer and at once for a fast one, and it is
the `sync_with_ping` barrier Core's `add_p2p_connection` runs after the
handshake, which returns on the node's own `verack` before the node has
processed this peer's. Core sends a transaction without waiting for it;
this waits until the node's `getrawmempool` lists it before the next
peer connects, which that barrier would not ensure of a node answering a
`ping` ahead of the `tx` its peer sent first
([ISS btclib-node#1410](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/issues/1410)).

Which peer was evicted is read off `Peer.is_connected`, Core's own
`is_connected`, which waits for nothing. Core reads it once for each
peer, after the evicting peer's `sync_with_ping`; `_evicted` below
repeats that sweep until some peer reads disconnected, within a scaled
bound, because bitcoind's `AttemptToEvictConnection` (`src/net.cpp`)
only marks the peer, and its socket is closed on a later pass of the
node's own network loop.

`p2p_eviction_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_eviction_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how, each handing it the argv that prints its own node's `-help`.
