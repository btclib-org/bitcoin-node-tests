"""Core's `p2p_getaddr_caching`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_getaddr_caching.py`
(`fa5f29774872`, 2025-12-16), an option and the clock together
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
a node listening on a loopback address and on two onion binds
(`Capability.LISTEN_ADDRESS`), its address table filled over
`addpeeraddress` (`Capability.KNOWN_ADDRESSES`), answers every `getaddr`
arriving through one bind with the same `MAX_ADDR_TO_SEND` addresses
while its clock (`Capability.CLOCK`) moves five minutes per round, a
different answer through each bind, and a new answer through each once
the clock has moved three days. Every check of Core's is kept, in its
order.

Core's node is started with its framework's own `-peertimeout` and
`connect=0` (`write_config`, `test_framework/util.py`); here they are
passed on the one start (`Capability.PEER_TIMEOUT`), so that the moved
clock drops no peer as inactive and the node dials none of the addresses
it is given. Core's loopback bind is its framework's own `bind=127.0.0.1`
(`bind_to_localhost_only`, `test_framework/test_framework.py`), and the
onion binds its test names keep `TestNode.start` from adding its own
(`test_framework/test_node.py`). An adapter's own `_command` may name a
`-bind` too, so the node is built from the class the caller passes,
`UnboundBitcoindAdapter` (`bitcoind_adapters_test.py`) for bitcoind leaving
it out, and all three binds are named here. Core's ports come from
`p2p_port`, unprobed; here all three come from `free_ports`.

Core's `AddrReceiver` keeps the addresses of the last `addr` message it
received, its `P2PInterface.on_version` sending the `getaddr`; here each
receiver is a `Peer` that sends it once its handshake is done, and its
answer is the `addr` message it reads, `_received_addrs` having how. Core's
`TestNode.add_p2p_connection` also finds each connection in
`getpeerinfo` and compares its user agent, a check of the framework's
own that is not made here.

`p2p_getaddr_caching_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_getaddr_caching_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
