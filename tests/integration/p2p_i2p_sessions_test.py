"""Core's `p2p_i2p_sessions`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_i2p_sessions.py` (`fa5f29774872`,
2025-12-16), a file of
[ISS 47](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/47):
a node given `-i2psam` dials an I2P address over a persistent SAM
session where `-i2pacceptincoming=1` and over a transient one where
`-i2pacceptincoming=0`. Both of Core's steps are kept, in its order,
each reading Core's own `i2p` line out of the node's debug log, so the
test asks for `Capability.I2P_SAM` and `Capability.DEBUG_LOG`.

Each line is read once, as soon as `addnode` returns, which is Core's own
`assert_debug_log` default. It matters for the persistent session: a node
given `-i2pacceptincoming=1` also tries to open that session on its own,
again and again while the bridge is missing, and each try writes the same
line (`CConnman::ThreadI2PAcceptIncoming`, `src/net.cpp`), so a log
polled for longer finds the line whether or not the dial wrote it.

Nothing listens at the `-i2psam` endpoint, which is what Core's file
assumes of its own. Core names a fixed port, `60000`; the endpoint here
is a port `node.free_port` hands out, bound and closed, and both nodes
are given it, as Core gives both its own.

Core's two nodes are not linked to each other here, where Core's
`setup_network` links them: neither step reads the other node.

A bitcoind before `v31.0` logs `Creating persistent SAM session`, without
`I2P` (bitcoin/bitcoin#34051). No probe tells the two apart, the node
having no option or RPC for it: that build is asked for its own line, read
off its own `getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 354](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/354)).

`p2p_i2p_sessions_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_i2p_sessions_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
