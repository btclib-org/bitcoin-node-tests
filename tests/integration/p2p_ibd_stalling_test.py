"""Core's `p2p_ibd_stalling`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_ibd_stalling.py` (`24628d3ae7dc`,
2026-09-14): during initial block download, a peer withholding the block
the node's download window cannot move past is a staller, and the node
reacts once the stalling timeout passes on its clock.

Each of Core's checks is a wire half and a log half, each body over a
fresh node:

- five outbound full-relay peers (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`) announce
  a chain whose first block, and a later one, every peer withholds. None
  is dropped while the chain fits the window; once it does not, the
  peer holding the first block is dropped after two seconds, the next
  after four and the one after that after eight, and once a peer sends
  the block the timeout is two seconds again and the chain connects up
  to the later withheld block. The log half asserts Core's own
  `Stall started` and `Decreased stalling timeout to 2 seconds`, and the
  absence of the first beside the second.
- a `manual` peer withholding the first block keeps its connection past
  the stalling timeout, its request is given to one of four outbound
  peers that serve every block, and the node asks it for no block until
  the cooldown has passed. The log half asserts Core's own
  `Pausing block downloads from stalling manual peer`.

Core's `P2PStaller` answers the node's `getdata` from its framework's
network thread, while the test waits on the node's RPC. Here `_Staller`
answers it on the test's own thread, and only where a wait reads its
connection. A wait for what the peers' answers bring about -- the blocks
in flight, which peer is asked for a block, the height -- first reads
each connected peer's connection up to the `pong` of a ping round trip,
answering whatever it read. `wait_for_disconnect` reads the one peer it
waits on, a wait for how many peers are connected reads each through
`Peer.is_connected` and answers nothing, and the wait of
`assert_debug_log` reads no connection. A peer the node closes during a
round trip fails the check, as it fails Core's. Core's
`num_test_p2p_connections` is `getpeerinfo`'s length, the node having no
peer of any other kind. Each body moves the node's clock
(`Capability.CLOCK`) as Core's does.

Core's harness starts every node with a `peertimeout`
(`write_config`, `test_framework/util.py`) and this port passes none:
`CConnman::InactivityCheck` (`src/net.cpp`) drops a peer that has
completed its handshake only once `TIMEOUT_INTERVAL` (`src/net.h`),
twenty minutes of the node's clock, passes without a message either way,
and neither check moves the clock that far in all.

Core runs its second check over its first check's node, restarted;
here it starts from the genesis block of a fresh one.

`addconnection` takes `manual` only past the pinned release
(bitcoin/bitcoin@4c79f3a34d003bd97824b032383ac816a4147d68), and the node
pauses a stalling `manual` peer rather than dropping it only from
bitcoin/bitcoin@698b5bbf3a0a0a52d97ae6acce2752769f14a208. Where the
build's own `help addconnection` names no `manual`
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35)),
the second check's bodies assert the refusal Core's
`RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER` answers instead.

`p2p_ibd_stalling_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_ibd_stalling_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
