"""Core's `p2p_ibd_txrelay`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_ibd_txrelay.py` (`fab352053d6e`,
2026-04-16): transaction relay while a node is in initial block
download. Two linked nodes started with `-minrelaytxfee`
(`Capability.MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE`) each send the other a `feefilter` of
`MAX_MONEY` rounded down to `FeeFilterRounder`'s top bucket while in
initial block download, read off each node's own `getpeerinfo` as Core
reads it. A node kept there by a block older than the maximum tip age
asks a peer announcing a transaction for nothing, even once its clock
has moved past Core's `NONPREF_PEER_TX_DELAY`, and processes no
transaction a peer sends it unasked. Once a block within that age takes
both nodes out of it, each sends the other a `feefilter` of the minimum
relay fee, the node asks a peer announcing the old block's coinbase by
its wtxid for it, and processes the transaction it ignored before.

Core's run is one sequence, and each body is that whole sequence over
two fresh nodes. The log half asserts besides what Core's
`assert_debug_log` asserts around each transaction sent unasked
(`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`): `received: tx` and no `was not accepted` in
initial block download, and `was not accepted` out of it. The wire half
sends each transaction all the same, and asserts of it only the ping
round trip after it. Each body asks for `Capability.MINE` and
`Capability.CLOCK` of the node under test, and `Capability.CONNECT` of
the node dialling it, as Core's `setup_network` has the second node
dial the first.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core builds the old block with `create_block` and has `generate` mine
  the block ending initial block download on the node's clock; here
  `build_next_block` (`mini_wallet.py`) builds each at the time Core's
  has, its coinbase paying `RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY`, and each is
  submitted over `submitblock`;
- Core's `P2PDataStore` records every `getdata` from its framework's
  network thread, and here the peer records those it reads in a ping
  round trip after its connection;
- Core's `disconnect_p2ps` waits for the node to count no test peer, and
  here the wait is for the node's own `getpeerinfo` to name the other
  node alone.

`p2p_ibd_txrelay_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_ibd_txrelay_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
