"""Core's `p2p_invalid_messages`, its four `addrv2` checks, over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_invalid_messages.py`
(`3fd68a95e68b`, 2026-04-07)'s own `test_addrv2_empty`,
`test_addrv2_no_addresses`, `test_addrv2_too_long_address` and
`test_addrv2_unrecognized_network`, each through the shared
`test_addrv2`: an `addrv2` with a hand-built payload, its own
`serialize` overridden so the raw octets travel unchecked by either
side's own codec, over a `SenderOfAddrV2` -- Core's own peer that
waits for the node's `sendaddrv2` before sending anything, so a node not
yet announcing BIP155 support is never bombarded with a message it may
not recognise. This repository's own `Peer.handshake` already negotiates
`WTXID_RELAY_VERSION` (`70016`), the same floor `net_processing.cpp`
gates `SENDADDRV2` on (`Signal ADDRv2 support (BIP155)`), so the node has
already sent it by the time `handshake` returns, and no explicit wait is
needed to reach the same guarantee `SenderOfAddrV2` asks for by name.

None of Core's own four checks disconnects the peer -- an addrv2 that
fails to deserialize throws out of `ProcessMessage`, and
`PeerManagerImpl::ProcessMessages`'s own `catch` (`src/net_processing.cpp`)
logs the exception and moves on, the same drop-but-keep outcome
`p2p_invalid_messages_dropped_test.py`'s own docstring argues from
`CNode::ReceiveMsgBytes`'s comment (`src/net.cpp`) for a message the
transport rejects -- so each is a wire-and-log pair of the same shape that
module already uses: a `ping` round-trip confirms the connection is still
there, and `Capability.DEBUG_LOG` gates the log half.

That round-trip also proves the `addrv2` before it was handled, on both
nodes: each processes a peer's messages in the order received, btclib-node
since [ISS btclib-node#1410](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/issues/1410),
a build before it answering a `ping` ahead of the messages queued before it.

`test_addrv2_unrecognized_network`'s two log lines past the first,
`9.9.9.9:8333` and `Added 1 addresses`, are `LogDebug(BCLog::ADDRMAN,
...)`'s (`src/addrman.cpp`), which `BitcoindAdapter._command`'s own
`-debug=addrman` enables. Its node is started for it, with two settings
Core's own run of this file has and `bitcoind_adapter` does not.
`-whitelist=addr@127.0.0.1` is `InvalidMessagesTest.set_test_params`'s
own: without `NetPermissionFlags::Addr`, `net_processing.cpp`'s own
address-rate limiter processes one of the two entries and defers the
other, and `std::shuffle` picks which, so `9.9.9.9` is added on some
runs and not on others. `-connect=0` is what Core's own `write_config`
(`test_framework/util.py`) gives every node, and what keeps
`CConnman::Start` (`src/net.cpp`) from starting `ThreadOpenConnections`:
measured against the pinned `31.1` without it, once `9.9.9.9` is in the
address manager that thread selects it over and over, each selection
one more `addrman` line in the log. The wire half starts one of these
nodes too rather than using `bitcoind_adapter`, which a session shares:
left holding the address, that node would write those lines for the
rest of the session.

btclib-node is started the same way, with `-connect=0`, so
`P2pManager._maybe_dial_more_peers` (`p2p/manager.py`) returns before
drawing from the address table the message has just filled with
`9.9.9.9:8333`, where `btclib_node_adapter`, which a session shares, would
draw it and dial it once holding fewer connections than it wants -- read
from that code rather than observed, a dial logging nothing until it
connects. `-listen=1` beside it keeps the listener `Peer` reaches, which
`-connect` otherwise turns off, as it does in Core.

`p2p_invalid_messages_addrv2_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_invalid_messages_addrv2_btclib_node_test.py` run every body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
