"""Core's `p2p_leak`: an obsolete version and a feature-negotiation boundary.

The obsolete version has a wire body and a log body, the boundary a wire
body, each over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_leak.py` (`36775471f81a`,
2026-09-09)'s own closing check, "old peers are disconnected", and its
feature-negotiation version boundary, rather than ported whole: the rest
of `P2PLeakTest.run_test` asks what a node sends *before* a handshake
completes and what a `version` message itself carries, which are fields
and orderings each implementation chooses for itself.

The boundary is the one part of that check ported: it asks only which
commands reach a peer. BIP339 requires `wtxidrelay` for a peer at 70016 or
higher, and BIP434 forbids a `feature` to a peer below 70017. No BIP fixes
the rest: Core withholds `wtxidrelay` below 70016, and sends `sendaddrv2`
only from 70016, as a courtesy to nodes that reject messages they do not
know (BIP155 sets no minimum version; `net_processing.cpp`, `v31.1`). The
body holds a node to Core's behaviour there.

It is Core's two peers that send a `version` and no `verack`, at 70015 and
at exactly 70016
(BIP339's `WTXID_RELAY_VERSION`): the node sends `wtxidrelay` and
`sendaddrv2` to the second and to the first neither, and sends neither of
them a `feature`. Where Core waits for each peer's own timeout and reads
what it received, `feature_negotiation_starts_at_the_wtxid_version`
reads up to the node's `verack`, which comes after the messages
negotiated.

Core's own check wraps the send in `assert_debug_log(["using obsolete
version 31799, disconnecting peer=5"])` and then calls
`wait_for_disconnect` -- the disconnect itself is `net_processing.cpp`'s
own `nVersion < MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION` (`node/protocol_version.h`,
`31800`), observable on the wire with no log at all, so
`obsolete_version_disconnects_the_peer` below asks for nothing.
`obsolete_version_is_logged` is the log half, Core's own wording for
*why* -- `peer using obsolete version` (`net_processing.cpp`), with
`peer=5` left out of the match, that number being Core's own connection
count in its longer test rather than a fact of the obsolete-version
check itself.

`p2p_leak_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_leak_btclib_node_test.py` run each,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
