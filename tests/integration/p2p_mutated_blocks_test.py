"""Core's `p2p_mutated_blocks`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_mutated_blocks.py` (`9c5dd2926aa9`,
2026-06-18): a peer sending a mutated block, one whose transactions no
longer match its header's merkle root, is dropped without clearing the
request the node has in flight for that block from an honest peer.

Each of Core's checks is a wire half and a log half, each body over a
fresh node:

- an outbound full-relay peer (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`) announces a
  block by its header, then by a `cmpctblock` whose transaction beside
  the coinbase the node asks for with `getblocktxn`; an inbound peer then
  sends the block with that transaction's version changed. The node drops
  the second peer, keeps the block in flight from the first, and takes
  the block once the first sends the `blocktxn`. The log half asserts
  bitcoind's own `Received mutated block from peer=1` and
  `Misbehaving: peer=1: mutated block`.
- a peer sending that block with its parent's hash replaced by one the
  node does not know is dropped, and the log half asserts bitcoind's own
  `AcceptBlock FAILED (prev-blk-not-found)`.

The header ahead of the `cmpctblock`, and the peer's own `sendcmpct`
ahead of both, are steps of Core's `master` and not of the pinned
release. Past that release a node ignores a `cmpctblock` it did not ask
for from a peer it has not chosen for high-bandwidth relay
(bitcoin/bitcoin@831359171582fc8220f9082049fddc0cc185f93d), and one from
a peer that never sent `sendcmpct`
(bitcoin/bitcoin@9c5dd2926aa97ba3d602185d5409e99f230acac4). The pinned
release passes with both steps.

The block spends a `MiniWallet` coin of the node under test, mined over
`Capability.MINE`, and is built and solved here rather than read from
`getblocktemplate`. BIP152's messages are btclib's own
`btclib.p2p.compact_blocks`, the `cmpctblock` built as
`p2p_compactblocks_blocksonly_test.py` builds one.

Core starts its node with `-testactivationheight=segwit@1`, so that a
block whose parent the node does not know is one segwit is not deployed
for, and the missing-parent block, which carries a witness, would read
as mutated (`unexpected-witness`) to a node checking it before looking
its parent up. Only the
missing-parent log half asks for it (`Capability.TEST_ACTIVATION_HEIGHT`):
that check's peer is dropped either way, and the mutated block extends a
tip segwit is active on with or without it. Core's own log line for the
mutated block, `Block mutated: bad-txnmrklroot, hashMerkleRoot mismatch`,
is in its `validation` category, which `BitcoindAdapter` does not enable,
so the log half reads the `net` category's lines for the same drop
instead: they say the block was mutated, and not why. Each
disconnect is awaited over `Peer`'s own default wait rather than Core's
five seconds, and the node's `getdata` and `getblocktxn` over Core's own.

`p2p_mutated_blocks_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_mutated_blocks_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
