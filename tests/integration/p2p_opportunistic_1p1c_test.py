"""Core's `p2p_opportunistic_1p1c`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_opportunistic_1p1c.py`
(`0bd3d3dfa562`, 2026-07-24): a parent refused for its fee is taken
into the mempool with a child paying for both, the two evaluated
together as one parent and one child (1p1c) where one peer sent both.
Each of the checks below is one of Core's `test_*` methods, a body over
a fresh node:

- a parent refused for its fee, announced ahead of its child by an
  outbound peer (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`), is asked for again once
  the child arrives and taken in with it, and not asked of another
  outbound peer announcing it; once for a parent with a witness and
  once for one with none;
- a child arriving ahead of its parent is kept as an orphan and taken
  in with it;
- a child paying too little for both is refused with its parent, and
  neither is asked of another peer or taken in when the parent is sent
  again, while a later child paying enough is taken in with it; once for
  a parent with a witness and once for one with none;
- a child whose witness is invalid is not evaluated with its parent
  sent by another peer, and neither peer is dropped once the child's
  own peer sends that parent;
- a parent whose witness is invalid, sent by another peer, is refused
  alone and leaves the child kept, which is taken in once its own peer
  sends the valid parent;
- no parent of a child of two parents, each refused for its fee, is
  asked for;
- a child of two parents, one of them in the mempool, is taken in with
  the other, where the build evaluates such a package, and refused with
  it otherwise;
- a parent and child spending the child of another such pair are taken
  in on top of it;
- a child kept as an orphan, its parent asked for, is taken in with that
  parent while other peers fill the orphanage with large orphans, some
  evicted where the build bounds each peer's share of the orphanage, none
  where it bounds their number alone;
- a child kept as an orphan, its parent asked for, stays kept and is
  taken in with that parent while other peers send small orphans, the
  same ones from each of a set of peers and others of its own from one
  more peer, where the build bounds each peer's share of the orphanage;
  where it bounds their number alone, the orphanage holds that bound
  once they are sent, and the child is taken in with its parent if still
  kept, and not if evicted at random.

Every body asks for `Capability.ORPHANAGE` first. It starts its node
with `-maxmempool=5` (`Capability.MAXMEMPOOL`) and a `-datacarriersize`
(`Capability.DATACARRIER`) and fills the mempool with
`mempool_util.fill_mempool`, so that its minimum fee rate stands above
the relay one, and mines its coins first (`Capability.MINE`,
`mini_wallet.MiniWallet`). Every body but the one chaining a package on
another moves the node's clock (`Capability.CLOCK`) where Core's does,
from the wall clock at its start; that one, as Core's own, waits out the
node's delays on the wall clock.

Core builds a transaction with no witness, whose txid is its wtxid,
with a `MiniWalletMode.RAW_P2PK` wallet: here `mine_p2pk_coins`
(`p2pk_coins_test.py`) mines coinbases paying `RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY`
ahead of the wallet's own, and `raw_p2pk_script_sig` (`mini_wallet.py`)
signs every spend of one.

Core's `P2PInterface` records the latest `getdata` from its framework's
network thread, and asks for whatever the node announces. Here `RelayConn`
(`p2p_conns_test.py`) does both on the test's own thread, where a wait
reads the peer's connection up to the `pong` of a ping round trip ahead
of every poll.

What differs from Core's file besides:

- `v29.4` refuses the `OP_RETURN` padding `fill_mempool` adds, as an
  output larger than its default `-datacarriersize`, with `scriptpubkey`,
  and `v30.3` and later do not (bitcoin/bitcoin#32406, first in
  `v30.0rc1`), so every body's node starts with the option;
- Core runs every check over one node, filled once, and ends each with
  its `cleanup`, which asserts the mempool's minimum fee rate still
  above the relay one; here each body starts a fresh node, fills its
  mempool and asserts none of that;
- Core gives each transaction its `create_tx_below_mempoolminfee` makes
  a sequence number of its own, so that no two of its checks make one
  txid on its one node; here every input's sequence number is zero;
- Core's invalid child is a `createrawtransaction` paying the node's own
  deterministic address, given a witness of garbage; here it is a
  self-transfer paying the same fee, its witness replaced by
  `malleated_to_invalid_witness`;
- Core's `RAW_P2PK` wallet signs a transaction's first input alone,
  drawing signatures until the scriptSig is of one fixed length; here
  every input is signed, under btclib's deterministic nonce, whatever
  the length.

Core's node starts with `-inboundrelaypercent=100` besides, an option
bitcoin/bitcoin@0bd3d3dfa562724e3dbc4cec2d4290e4561655cd adds and
`v32.0rc1` is the first tag to carry, and which the pinned `v31.1`
refuses as unknown. Here the check sending many orphans, the one
connecting the most inbound peers, passes it to a bitcoind whose
`getnetworkinfo` `version` reads at or past `v32.0`'s, and to no other
node. The option sets the share of inbound slots that peers relaying
transactions may take (`CConnman::Init`, `src/net.h`), which `v31.1`
does not bound, and the share it defaults to admits every peer that
check connects: so the check asserts the same on either build, with the
option or without it. A `master` build between the option's merge and
the version's move to `32.99` reads older and starts without it, the
constant's own comment having the commits.

A build before `v30.0rc1` bounds the orphanage by count alone, at
`DEFAULT_MAX_ORPHAN_TRANSACTIONS` (`-maxorphantx`, `src/net_processing.h`),
evicting an orphan at random once the bound is passed
(`TxOrphanage::LimitOrphans`, `src/txorphanage.cpp`);
bitcoin/bitcoin#31829, of which `v30.0rc1` is the first tag, bounds each
peer's share instead. Core's own `v29.4` file has no check of either. The
two orphanage checks read the build off `getorphantxs`'s `help`, which
lists `expiration` before bitcoin/bitcoin#31829 and not after.

A bitcoind before bitcoin/bitcoin#31385, first in `v30.0rc1`, refuses a
child of two parents when one of them is in the mempool. Core's `v29.4`
file asserts that refusal, and so does the check on such a build.
bitcoin/bitcoin#31385 changes no RPC, so the check reads the build's
`getnetworkinfo` `version` against `_TWO_PARENT_VERSION`.

Core's many-orphans check counts each peer sending one of the same small
orphans as an announcement of it, adding up past the orphanage's bound
on its latency score, `DEFAULT_MAX_ORPHANAGE_LATENCY_SCORE`
(`src/node/txorphanage.h`). A node drops an orphan it already keeps when
another peer sends it as a `tx`, recording no announcement for that peer
(`TxDownloadManagerImpl::ReceivedTx`, `src/node/txdownloadman_impl.cpp`):
so `getorphantxs` lists each orphan the check sends under one announcer,
on the pinned release and on a `master` build alike, every one of them
kept, and the check stays below that bound.

`p2p_opportunistic_1p1c_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_opportunistic_1p1c_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
