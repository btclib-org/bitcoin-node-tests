"""Core's `p2p_outbound_eviction`, as bodies over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_outbound_eviction.py`
(`fa5f29774872`, 2025-12-16): an outbound peer that has not announced a
block with as much work as the node's tip once `CHAIN_SYNC_TIMEOUT`
passes on the node's clock is sent a `getheaders`, and is dropped once
`HEADERS_RESPONSE_TIME` passes with no such block; a peer catching up
with the tip the timer was set against, or with the tip itself, is kept;
a full-relay peer that had announced the tip is protected and kept; a
block-relay-only one never is.

Each of Core's checks is a body over a fresh node:

- unprotected: a peer sending no headers, and one sending the header of
  the tip's parent, are each dropped; a peer lagging a block behind the
  tip but catching up with each tip the timer was set against is kept,
  over each of Core's rounds, and kept once it catches up with the tip;
- protected: a full-relay peer that announced the tip is kept after both
  timeouts, the node having mined a block past it;
- mixed: of eight full-relay peers, the four that announced the tip are
  kept, and of the four others the two catching up are kept while the
  one that sent a lagging header and the one that sent none are dropped;
- block-relay-only: a block-relay-only peer that announced the tip is
  dropped as an unprotected one is.

Every body has the node dial its peers (`Capability.TYPED_OUTBOUND`),
moves the node's clock as Core's does (`Capability.CLOCK`), and mines
(`Capability.MINE`): its own chain first, two blocks at the node's
clock where Core's node starts on its framework's cached chain, Core's
checks reading the tip and its parent alone; then each block Core's
`generateblock` mines to `raw(42)`, paid where the adapter's own `mine`
pays instead. Every body restarts its node with settings Core's own
harness gives every node (`Capability.PEER_TIMEOUT`), `_HARNESS_ARGS`
below.

Core's `wait_for_getheaders` pops the latest `getheaders` its framework's
network thread recorded, and waits for the next where that one does not
match. `Peer.last_message` holds only what a read of the connection
returned, and `Peer.sync_with_ping` reads up to the `pong` answering its
`ping`, so a `getheaders` the node sent ahead of that `pong` is recorded
by the time the body waits for it, as it is in Core. Where a peer is
protected, Core's own `getheaders` wait is met by the one the node sent
the peer on connecting, which asks from the same block, the node sending
a protected peer no other.

`p2p_outbound_eviction_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_outbound_eviction_btclib_node_test.py` run each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
