r"""Core's `p2p_private_broadcast`, rewritten on this harness: btclib-node.

`p2p_private_broadcast_test.py` beside this module is the body, run here
against the target rather than the oracle (rule 3 of issue
btclib-org/btclib#2220). The test is a counted skip on
`Capability.PRIVATE_BROADCAST`, which `btclib_node.py`'s own docstring has
no build declaring.
