"""Core's `p2p_private_broadcast_retry_v1`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_private_broadcast_retry_v1.py`
(`4e8c4bc794c0`, 2026-08-04): a private broadcast connection to an IPv4
address goes through the Tor proxy, and where its v2 handshake fails, the
v1 retry to the same address goes through the Tor proxy too.

The node is given a `socks5.Socks5Proxy` for every network, `-proxy`,
and another for Tor, `-onion`, as Core's is. The first forwards each
connection to a `_V2Peer`, a v1 peer whose `version` offers
`NODE_P2P_V2`, until the restart, so that the node's address manager
marks each IPv4 address as speaking v2. The second forwards the first
IPv4 address it is asked for, and every later request for that address,
to a `_Sniffer`, which reads the start of what the node sends and
closes: v1's network magic, or the start of v2's key.

The body asks for `Capability.PRIVATE_BROADCAST`, and for the capability
of every other option its node is given: `PROXY` for `-proxy` and
`-onion`, `V2TRANSPORT` for `-v2transport`, and `PEER_TIMEOUT` for the
`-peertimeout` Core's harness gives every node; `KNOWN_ADDRESSES` for
Core's own `fill_node_addrman` (`test_framework/test_framework.py`) and
`MINE` for its `MiniWallet`. Core's `-test=addrman`, a test-only option of
bitcoind's own, and the `-dnsseed=0` of Core's `write_config` are passed
with no capability of their own. Every step of Core's file is kept in its
order.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core's node starts on its harness's cached chain. Here `MiniWallet`
  mines a coin to maturity first.
- The Tor proxy closes every connection to an IPv4 address other than the
  first, where Core forwards each to a peer answering in v2: `Peer`
  (`peer.py`) speaks v1 alone. The node retries each in v1, and the retry
  is closed too. Nothing Core's file reads is on those connections.

`p2p_private_broadcast_retry_v1_bitcoind_test.py` and
`p2p_private_broadcast_retry_v1_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
