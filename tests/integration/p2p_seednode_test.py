"""Core's `p2p_seednode`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_seednode.py` (`fa5f29774872`,
2025-12-16), a file of
[ISS 47](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/47):
a node given no `-seednode` asks none, one whose address table is empty
asks its `-seednode` at once, and one whose table holds addresses dials
those first and asks its `-seednode` only once its wait has passed.
Every step of Core's `run_test` is kept, in its order, over one node,
each reading Core's own lines out of the node's debug log, those it
expects and those it does not.

The test asks for `Capability.ADDRESS_FETCH`, `Capability.KNOWN_ADDRESSES`
for Core's `addpeeraddress`, `Capability.PROXY` for the unreachable
proxy, `Capability.CLOCK` for `setmocktime` and `Capability.DEBUG_LOG`.

No peer answers. Every start is given Core's `UNREACHABLE_PROXY_ARG`
(`test_framework/netutil.py`), a `-proxy` nothing listens at, so every
address the node dials and every seed node it asks is reached through a
proxy that is not there.

The node is built with Core's own `extra_args` and started with them
from its first start, as Core's `set_test_params` has it, and every
restart is given them, with a `-seednode` where Core's `restart_node`
adds one. Core's `write_config` (`test_framework/util.py`) also writes
`dnsseed=0` into the node's `bitcoin.conf`, so `-dnsseed=0` joins every
start here: through a proxy, a regtest node asks for its chain's own
`dummySeed.invalid.` otherwise. Its `fixedseeds=0` line is not passed,
regtest having no fixed seeds (`CRegTestParams`,
`src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`). It writes no `connect=0`, Core's file
turning `disable_autoconnect` off, and `BitcoindAdapter` passes no
`-connect` on regtest either.

Core's harness starts its node with `-v2transport=0` unless its own
`--v2transport` is given, where this one leaves bitcoind's own default.
The `trying v1 connection` line holds
under either: `addpeeraddress` keeps an address with no `NODE_P2P_V2`
service (`src/rpc/net.cpp`), and `CConnman::ThreadOpenConnections`
(`src/net.cpp`) dials v2 only an address that has it.

The node starts on a fresh chain, where Core's, its `setup_clean_chain`
left unset, starts on its cached one; no step reads the chain. Its ports
come from `node.free_ports`, where Core derives them from its own index.
Each log wait counts from the end of its block, as `assert_debug_log`
(`debug_log.py`) counts it, where Core's counts from its start.

Core's last step also passes with its `setmocktime` removed, here and
under Core's own framework alike (measured against the pinned release):
the node's own wait then passes on the real clock, inside the step's.

`p2p_seednode_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_seednode_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
