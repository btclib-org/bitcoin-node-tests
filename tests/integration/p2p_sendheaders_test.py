"""Core's `p2p_sendheaders`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_sendheaders.py` (`6eca11175be6`,
2026-07-16), a file needing no mechanism the adapter lacks
([ISS 317](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/317)):
a node announces a new block to a peer by `inv` until the peer sends
`sendheaders`, and by `headers` after it. Two nodes are linked as
Core's `setup_network` links them (`Capability.CONNECT`), the first
mining (`Capability.GENERATE`) and the second mining the chains that
reorganise it (`Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`). Two peers connect to
the first node: one that only ever reads `inv`s, and one without
`NODE_NETWORK`, whose announcements are the subject.

- A `getheaders` with no locator answers the header its stop hash
  names only where that block is validated.
- Before `sendheaders`, every block is announced by `inv`, whatever
  the peer asked for or announced in between.
- After it, every block is announced by its header, whether the peer
  announced blocks of its own by `inv` or by `headers` in between. The
  same announcement from the other peer causes no second `getdata`, and
  the blocks it announced are not announced back to it.
- A reorganisation connecting no more than Core's
  `MAX_BLOCKS_TO_ANNOUNCE` blocks is announced by their headers, and a
  longer one by an `inv` of the tip. Announcements then stay `inv`s
  until the peer sends a `getheaders` for the tip or announces it, a
  `getdata` or an older `getheaders` not restoring them.
- Headers leading to as much work as the tip or more are fetched at
  once, up to Core's `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER` blocks in flight.
  Headers leading to less work are not, and neither are blocks already
  stored.
- A header that does not connect is answered with a `getheaders`, and
  the headers sent in answer are fetched. Every further such header is
  answered with a `getheaders` too.

The peer reading `inv`s is never asked for a block.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core's `P2PInterface` records what the node sends from its
  framework's network thread; here `_Conn` does it on the test's own
  thread, a wait reading the connection until its condition holds;
- Core checks that the node answered an `inv` of a block it lacks with
  no second `getheaders`, and that the peer reading `inv`s was never
  asked for a block, on whatever its network thread has read so far;
  here each is checked once the node answers a `ping` sent after it
  (`Peer.sync_with_ping`), so that each reads every message the node
  sent before;
- each block is built with btclib in the shape of Core's own
  `create_block` and `create_coinbase` (`blocktools.py`), its coinbase
  paying `OP_TRUE`.

Every step is the same at `v31.1`, the release `bitcoind.py` pins:
Core's file there differs from the pinned revision only in handing each
`create_block` a coinbase of its own `create_coinbase` rather than a
height, and in writing its `test_function` predicates as lambdas.

`p2p_sendheaders_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_sendheaders_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
