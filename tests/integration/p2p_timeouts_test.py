"""Core's `p2p_timeouts`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/p2p_timeouts.py` (`fa4cb96bdec2`,
2026-02-17), the option, clock and log families together
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
a node started with `-peertimeout=3` (`Capability.PEER_TIMEOUT`) keeps
three peers that never finish the handshake -- one sending `version`
and never `verack`, one sending only `ping`, one sending nothing -- for
two seconds of its own clock (`Capability.CLOCK`), and drops all three
two seconds later. `CConnman::InactivityCheck` (`src/net.cpp`) reads
`m_peer_connect_timeout` and the mockable clock, so the clock alone
decides when each check first reaches a peer.

Each fact of Core's own `run_test` is given the half it is observable
in, the log family's own rule (issue #5). The wire half reads whether
the node still holds each connection off `getpeerinfo`, and each drop
off `Peer.wait_for_disconnect`; Core reads its own side's
`is_connected` for the first and the same wait for the second. The log
half asserts Core's own lines around the same steps
(`Capability.DEBUG_LOG`): the connection each peer opens, the `ping`
each refused before the handshake, and the reason each drop gives. Its
peer ids are the node's first three, each test starting its own node.
Core's `-v2transport` branch of the expected lines is dropped: `Peer`
speaks the v1 wire alone.

The node is restarted with two settings Core's own harness gives every
node it starts and `BitcoindAdapter` does not. `-v2transport=0` is
`TestNode.__init__`'s own default: under the pinned release's default of
`1`, a connection whose first message is not `version` is taken for a
BIP324 one, and the node answers the `ping` of the peer that never sent
`version` with a v2 handshake rather than the log line Core asserts,
measured against the pinned release. `-connect=0` is `write_config`'s
own (`test_framework/util.py`, `disable_autoconnect`), leaving every
connection the node holds one the test opened.

Core's closing check, a start with `-peertimeout=0` refused with its own
`expected_msg`, is a third test, matched against the whole of the node's
stderr as `assert_start_raises_init_error` matches it by default.

`p2p_timeouts_bitcoind_test.py` and `p2p_timeouts_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
