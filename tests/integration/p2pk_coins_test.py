"""The no-witness coins and transactions of Core's `RAW_P2PK` wallet.

Core builds a transaction whose txid is its wtxid with a
`MiniWalletMode.RAW_P2PK` wallet. `mine_p2pk_coins` mines coinbases paying
`RAW_P2PK_SCRIPT_PUB_KEY` on a node, and `p2pk_tx`, `p2pk_self_transfer`
and `p2pk_self_transfer_multi` spend them under `raw_p2pk_script_sig`
(`mini_wallet.py`), which `MiniWallet` does not.

This module holds no test: its name ends `_test` for the repository's
`name-tests-test` hook.
