"""Core's `rpc_dumptxoutset`, rewritten on this repository's harness.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_dumptxoutset.py`:
`rpc_dumptxoutset_test.py` beside this module is the body, run here
against bitcoind, which declares every capability it asks for. Whether
that body expects a dump at a height a fork also reaches, or the pinned
release's refusal of it, is read from the running build's own
`getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35)),
`_ROLLS_BACK_PAST_A_FORK_VERSION` below having why.
