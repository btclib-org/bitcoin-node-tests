"""Core's `rpc_dumptxoutset`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_dumptxoutset.py` (`58eeab790d98`,
2026-05-13), the clock and disk families together
([ISS 14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
a node whose clock is set to just past its genesis block
(`Capability.CLOCK`) mines `COINBASE_MATURITY` blocks
(`Capability.GENERATE`) and writes its UTXO set to a file in its chain
directory over `dumptxoutset` (`Capability.DUMP_UTXO_SET`), answering
the coins it wrote, the block the set is at and its height, the file's
absolute path, the set's own hash and the chain's transaction count. It
refuses a path already holding a file, a path in a directory that does
not exist and a snapshot type it does not know, each with Core's own
code and message. Then `invalidateblock` (`Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`)
and blocks mined under the wall clock give it a fork below its tip,
`reconsiderblock` puts it back on its own chain, and a
`rollback` dump at the fork's height is at that height and at the block
the node's own chain has there, with Core's `in_memory` option and
without.

Not every build dumps at a height a fork also reaches: the pinned release
refuses to, the fork's own block taking the tip once the node rolls back,
so the caller says which the running node is expected to do, and the
refusal is asserted with the build's own code and message.

Core asserts the hashes as constants: the block at the tip, the file's
own SHA256 and `txoutset_hash`. Each depends on the coinbase the
build writes, and Core's own file carries different constants at `v31.1`
than at the pin. This asserts each against what the same node reports:
the block `getblockhash` answers at the tip's height; the file's
metadata naming that block, the regtest network and the coins written,
and a second dump of the same chain writing the same bytes; and
`gettxoutsetinfo`'s own `hash_serialized_3`.

Every block pays Core's own first deterministic address,
`TestNode.PRIV_KEYS`'s own, the one Core's `generate` pays.

The node is built over a data directory of its own, through
`make_adapter` (`tests/integration/conftest.py`), since the test reads
the file the node writes inside it.

`rpc_dumptxoutset_bitcoind_test.py` and
`rpc_dumptxoutset_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
