"""Core's `rpc_echo_payload`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_echo_payload.py` (`fa7bc26d1276`,
2026-08-06), an option-family row
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#3](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/3)):
a node restarted with `-rpcworkqueue=2` and `-rpcthreads=2`
(`Capability.RPC_WORK_QUEUE`) takes payloads of random length, large
ones included, from more concurrent callers than its threads and its
queue hold, each payload sent through `echo` or `sendrawtransaction`
chosen at random, and answers or refuses every request rather than
leaving one to time out: a timeout is `bitcoin_core_rpc`'s own
`FetchError`, which neither `except` clause of `_call_repeatedly`
catches.

A smaller claim than Core's own test, declared rather than silent: Core
matches a refusal on its message, "Work queue depth exceeded" after the
HTTP 503 status, where `bitcoin_core_rpc`'s own `HttpError` carries the
status alone, the body of a non-JSON reply not being kept, so a refusal
here is the 503 status. Each caller keeps one connection of its own
across its calls, the adapter holding one per thread (`node.py`'s
`_ThreadSessions`) the way Core's own threads each hold the one
`create_new_rpc_connection` gives them, so up to `_CALLERS` requests
are in flight at once.

A bitcoind serving HTTP through libevent, as every release before `v32.0`
does (bitcoin/bitcoin#35182, first in `v32.0rc1`), can leave a request on a
kept-alive connection unanswered. The pull
request adding Core's file (bitcoin/bitcoin#34927) failed in CI on it until
libevent was removed, and notes that a new connection works around it.
So a build whose `logging` lists the `libevent` category, which
bitcoin/bitcoin#35597 removed, is called over a connection of its own per
call, as `urlopen_transport` makes one. That is the one difference from
Core's file, which keeps each caller's connection.

`rpc_echo_payload_bitcoind_test.py` and
`rpc_echo_payload_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
