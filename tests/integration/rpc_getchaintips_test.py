"""Core's `rpc_getchaintips`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_getchaintips.py` (`fa16bc53d79c`,
2026-04-16), a file needing no mechanism the adapter lacks
([ISS 317](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/317)):
four nodes linked in a line, as Core's `setup_network` links them
(`Capability.CONNECT`), the first reporting its active tip alone
(`Capability.CHAIN_TIPS`). The network is
split between the second and the third node (`Capability.DISCONNECT`),
and each half mines a chain of its own (`Capability.GENERATE`), the
second half's longer. Each half
reports its own tip alone; once joined, the first node reports the long
tip as active and the short one as a `valid-fork` branching off it.
Isolated again, the first node is given the header of a block whose
coinbase pays too much and the header of a child of it: that chain is
its `headers-only` tip, and the block itself, once submitted, turns it
`invalid`.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core's nodes start on a cached chain two hundred blocks high; here
  the first node mines those blocks, paying Core's own `PRIV_KEYS[0]`
  address, before the test's first check;
- Core's `generate` has each node pay its own `PRIV_KEYS` address, and
  so does this body, through `generatetoaddress`, so that the two halves
  mine different blocks;
- Core's `disconnect_nodes` asks the node that was dialled to drop the
  node that dialled it, and `node.disconnect_nodes` asks the dialler;
  this body then waits for the other side too, as Core's does;
- each block is built with btclib in the shape of Core's own
  `create_block` and `create_coinbase` (`blocktools.py`), its coinbase
  paying `OP_TRUE`.

Every step is the same at `v31.1`, the release `bitcoind.py` pins: Core's
file there differs from the pinned revision only in how it hands
`create_block` a coinbase and a time.

`rpc_getchaintips_bitcoind_test.py` and
`rpc_getchaintips_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
