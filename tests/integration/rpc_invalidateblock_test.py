"""Core's `rpc_invalidateblock`, one body over either node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_invalidateblock.py`
(`fab352053d6e`, 2026-04-16), a file needing no mechanism the adapter
lacks ([ISS 317](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/317)):
`invalidateblock` and `reconsiderblock` (`Capability.INVALIDATE_BLOCK`)
mark a block invalid and take the mark back off. The nodes start
unlinked on a clean chain, and the first and the second node each mine a
chain of their own (`Capability.GENERATE`), the second node's longer.
Linked (`Capability.CONNECT`), the first node reorgs to the second
node's chain and is given the header of a block on top of it.
Invalidating a block of that chain takes the first node back to its own,
with no header left beyond its tip; reconsidering that chain's tip
counts the header beyond it again, and invalidating the block once more
takes the first node back. With the second and the third node linked,
each invalidates a block of the shared chain, and the third mines a
block on what is left: no node reorgs to a chain of less work. With the
first node's own chain invalidated and the other chain reconsidered, an
ancestor of that chain's tip is invalidated; reconsidering the header
then makes the header's last ancestor holding its block data the tip,
the header counted beyond it. Reconsidering a block reconsiders its
invalidated ancestors, and reconsidering an ancestor reconsiders its
invalidated descendants. An unknown block is refused as not found.

What differs from Core's file:

- Core's `generate` has each node pay its own `PRIV_KEYS` address, and
  so does this body, through `generatetoaddress`, so that the first and
  the second node mine different chains;
- Core's `generatetodescriptor` pays `ADDRESS_BCRT1_UNSPENDABLE_DESCRIPTOR`
  (`test_framework/address.py`), an `addr()` descriptor; this body pays
  the address it wraps, through `generatetoaddress`;
- the header is built with btclib in the shape of Core's own
  `create_block` (`blocktools.py`), its coinbase paying `OP_TRUE`;
- the check that a reconsidered block's ancestors become tip candidates
  runs where the running build's `getnetworkinfo` `version` is `v30.0`
  or later, the first release carrying Core's change and Core's own file
  gaining the check with it. A build before it, `v29.4` among them,
  keeps its tip below the header's ancestors and later aborts on its own
  `CheckBlockIndex`; Core's own file at `v29.4` leaves the check out, as
  this body does there. The threshold leaves the check out where it
  could run only for a `master` build reporting `29.99` taken after the
  change's merge,
  bitcoin/bitcoin@a40e9536588c366886de4f4b9d67b8665a509929.

Every step is the same at `v31.1`, the release `bitcoind.py` pins: Core's
file there differs from the pinned revision only in how it hands
`create_block` a coinbase and a time.

`rpc_invalidateblock_bitcoind_test.py` and
`rpc_invalidateblock_btclib_node_test.py` run it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
