"""Core's `rpc_scanblocks`, rewritten on this harness: bitcoind.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_scanblocks.py` (`aeca0610865e`,
2026-07-01), the option and MiniWallet families together
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#14](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/14)):
`-blockfilterindex=1` (`Capability.BLOCK_FILTER_INDEX`) keeps BIP158's
basic filter per block, `scanblocks` answers from it, and
`MiniWallet.send_to` (`Capability.MINE`) pays the two outputs the scans
look for.

Core's own claim in full, in Core's own order: a scan by address and by
ranged `pkh()` descriptor, `start_height` and `stop_height` bounding
it, `filter_false_positives` either way, a precomputed false positive
colliding with the regtest genesis block's coinbase output, the second
node started without the index refusing a scan, and every argument
error Core's file asserts. Four spellings change. Core's `generate`
mines the mempool node-side and flushes the validation queue before
returning; this mines the two payments client-side,
`MiniWallet.generate`'s own `confirm` naming them, and then waits for
the index to reach the tip. Core's `getnewdestination` is a random
key's P2TR output here too, built by `ScriptPubKey.p2tr`. Core checks
its false positive with `bip158_basic_element_hash` over the scripts
`getblock` reports; this builds the genesis block's own filter with
`BasicBlockFilter.from_block` and asks it to `match` both scripts, the
single-element filter matching a script exactly where that script's
ranged hash equals the coinbase output's. Core's refusal of a null
`scanobjects` is its `master`'s wording, from the pinned commit on;
the pinned release refuses the same call with a type error, and either
refusal passes, each with its own code.

The second node is independent of the first -- never connected, never
synced -- and asked for nothing but the refusal, so it is its own test
here rather than a second adapter inside the first.
