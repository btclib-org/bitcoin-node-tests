"""Core's `rpc_scantxoutset`, rewritten on tf2's own harness: bitcoind.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_scantxoutset.py`:
`rpc_scantxoutset_test.py` beside this module is the body, run here
against bitcoind, which declares every capability it asks for. Whether
that body expects a null in place of `start`'s scan objects refused as
Core's pinned file refuses it is read from the running build's own
`getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35)),
`_NULL_AS_MISSING_VERSION` below having why.
