"""Core's `rpc_uptime`, one body over each node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_uptime.py` (`406c2348ddbf`,
2026-06-13) rather than ported: that file drives a `TestNode` over
Core's own harness and reads `time.sleep`/`uptime`/`setmocktime` as
`TestNode` attributes. This rewrites the same subject over `NodeAdapter`
(rule 5 of issue btclib-org/btclib#2220: tf2's own adapter). No
deviation from Core's own claim on a build with bitcoin/bitcoin#34328: a
single clean-chain node, `uptime` before and after `Capability.CLOCK`
(`capability.py`) jumps the clock forward, is the whole of what either
file asks.

Each `rpc_uptime_<node>_test.py` module beside this one runs it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.

A bitcoind before `v31.0` counts `uptime` from the wall clock, so it
follows `setmocktime` (bitcoin/bitcoin#34328). No probe tells the two
apart, the node having no option or RPC for it: that build is asserted to
follow the mock clock, as Core's own file did there, read off its own
`getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 354](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-functional-tests/issues/354)).
