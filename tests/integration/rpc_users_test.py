"""Core's `rpc_users`, one body over each node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_users.py` (`faf993ee4421`,
2026-05-26), disk-family mechanism alone (issue btclib-org/btclib#2220,
[ISS 7](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/7)):
`rpcauth`, `rpcuser`/`rpcpassword` and `rpccookieperms` are each written
to the datadir this adapter is given, either through `bitcoin.conf`
before it ever starts or on the command line as `extra_args` -- neither
needs an adapter change, `NodeAdapter.__init__`'s own
`_check_extra_args` raising nothing for any of the three, none of them
an option either adapter's `_command()` sets itself.

A smaller claim than Core's own file, declared rather than silent.
Dropped: the `rpcauth.py` script Core's own harness runs as a
subprocess to generate two of its four credentials, and the
`SystemRandom`-chosen username -- both a claim about that script rather
than about `Capability.RPC_AUTH_CONFIG`, which `_rpcauth_line` below
generates a credential for the same way `rpc_whitelist_test.py`
already does. `-rpcuser`/`-rpcpassword` and `-norpccookiefile` each
write no RPC cookie, measured live against `31.1` --
`rpcauth` given alongside either does not bring the cookie back -- so a
client that waits on the cookie the adapter's `_rpc_client()`
otherwise reads never sees one and `start` timed out rather than the
node ever answering RPC
([ISS bitcoin-node-tests#34](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/34)).
`rpc_auth`
(`NodeAdapter.__init__`, `node.py`) is what lets them back in: the
caller that puts either flag in `extra_args` already knows the
plaintext credential it chose there, exactly as Core's own harness
knows the plaintext of whatever it wrote into `bitcoin.conf`, and
passes it to the adapter instead of leaving the readiness wait on a
cookie the node never writes. Core's own equivalent test hits the
identical gap for `-norpccookiefile` alone and works around it with
`busy_wait_for_debug_log`, an alternate readiness wait keyed on the
debug log rather than RPC -- unneeded here, since `-norpccookiefile`
below is paired with an `-rpcauth` value whose plaintext this file
already holds, unlike Core's own `test_norpccookiefile`, which pairs it
with a `-rpcauth` value `get_auth_cookie`
(`test_framework/util.py`) has no way to recover the plaintext of from
`bitcoin.conf` alone. Of Core's own `test_auth` combinations, the
`-rpcuser`/`-rpcpassword` test checks the right credential and a wrong
password only: the wrong user and the wrong pair go through the same
comparison (`CheckUserAuthorized`, `httprpc.cpp`) that
`rpcauth_via_config_authenticates_and_refuses` already drives
through all four. Dropped last: `platform.system() == 'Windows'`
is never this repository's own gate (`CONTRIBUTING.md`'s own table: one
image, `ubuntu-latest`), so the branch `test_rpccookieperms` takes on
it is unreachable here and the POSIX permission check below is the
whole of that test.

Ported, against its own capability rather than `RPC_AUTH_CONFIG`:
Core's own "-norpcauth disables previous -rpcauth params" check,
`Capability.RPC_AUTH_NEGATION` (`capability.py`) -- a fact
`BitcoindAdapter` declares unconditionally and `BtclibNodeAdapter`
declares only on a build its own `_negates_rpcauth` finds reading
`-norpcauth`, so this test's own row on any other build of that node is
a counted skip rather than a narrowed run. Every other test asks
`Capability.RPC_AUTH_CONFIG` before it starts the node, and counts
a skip where the build lacks it: `-rpcauth` and `-rpccookieperms` are
not recognised at all, in `bitcoin.conf` or on the command line, by a
btclib-node build before
[ISS btclib-node#1070](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/issues/1070).

A malformed `-rpcauth` value's refusal is matched in Core's own wording
alone, `_INIT_ERROR`: `Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See
debug log for details.`, the whole text Core's `rpc_users.py` compares,
anchored past `_wait_for_rpc`'s own `stderr: ` (`node.py`) and at the
message's end, so that a stderr carrying anything beside the refusal
fails it. Every one of the malformed values refuses with that generic
init error on bitcoind and on btclib-node from
[PR btclib-node#1319](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib-node/pull/1319)
(release `v2026.10.4`) on, as does a cookie the node cannot write:
`__init__.py`'s own `RPC_INIT_ERROR` in btclib-node is that string
verbatim, raised whenever `rpc_manager.start_listener()` fails for any
reason, cookie generation included.

Each `rpc_users_<node>_test.py` module beside this one runs it,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
