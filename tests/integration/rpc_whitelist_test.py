r"""Core's `rpc_whitelist`, as bodies over each node.

Read from Core's `test/functional/rpc_whitelist.py` (`fad441867c9b`,
2026-10-12), disk-family mechanism alone (issue btclib-org/btclib#2220,
[ISS 7](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/7)):
`rpcauth`, `rpcwhitelist` and `rpcwhitelistdefault` are `bitcoin.conf`
keys, written to the datadir this adapter is given before it ever
starts -- no `extra_args` and no adapter change, `bitcoin.conf` living
at the same path a caller already holds (`datadir_path`'s own
constructor argument).

A smaller claim than Core's own file, declared rather than silent: two
users rather than Core's `strange_users` roster of malformed-input
edge cases, which asks what a hand-written parser does with a blank or
a doubled permission list rather than what `rpcwhitelist` restricts --
a claim about this project's own config parser, not about the
mechanism `Capability.RPC_AUTH_CONFIG` names. The `rpcauth` credential
below is generated the way Core's own `share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py`
generates one (`salt$hmac_sha256(salt, password)`), read from that
script rather than run: this repository ships no copy of it.

`Capability.RPC_AUTH_CONFIG` is asked before `bitcoin.conf` is written,
so a build without it skips before the data directory exists.
`btclib_node.py`'s own docstring is where that capability's
per-executable probe is argued.

Core's `test_rejected_method_logging` is a body of its own, asking for
`Capability.DEBUG_LOG` besides: a method the whitelist refuses is
logged as named, sent alone or in a batch, whether it carries a newline
that could forge a log line or every printable special character. A
bitcoind escapes the newline as `\x0a` from bitcoin/bitcoin#35833, which
no release carries, and writes it raw before; which of the two is
asserted is read off the build's own `getnetworkinfo` `version`
([ISS 35](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/35)).

Each `rpc_whitelist_<node>_test.py` module beside this one runs each body,
`tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having how.
