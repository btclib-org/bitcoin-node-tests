"""Core's `wallet_disable`, rewritten on tf2's own harness: bitcoind.

Read from Core's `test/functional/wallet_disable.py` (`3fd68a95e68b`,
2026-04-07; the pinned `v31.1` differs only in asserting with `assert`
where this revision calls `assert_equal`): a node started under
`-disablewallet` answers no wallet RPC and still validates an address.
Every assertion of Core's own is kept.

A bitcoind-only test in `capability.py`'s own sense: `-disablewallet` is
bitcoind's own option, so this module asks `require` for nothing and has
no `_btclib_node_test.py` counterpart. It asks for no
`Capability.NODE_WALLET` either, as Core's file does not skip where the
build carries no wallet: such a build still accepts `-disablewallet`,
among the wallet options `src/dummywallet.cpp` registers for it, and
answers no wallet RPC regardless.
