"""Core's `wallet_miniscript_decaying_multisig_descriptor_psbt`, one body.

Read from Core's
`test/functional/wallet_miniscript_decaying_multisig_descriptor_psbt.py`
(`88f802983571`, 2026-01-31, the same file at the pinned `v31.1`): a
watch-only wallet imports a miniscript `thresh` over four signers' keys
and three block-height locks, so that it spends 4-of-4 before the first
lock, then 3-of-4, 2-of-4 and 1-of-4 as each lock height is reached. Each
spend is a PSBT the signers complete one after another, in a random
order; a spend signed by fewer signers than all four is refused as
`non-final` before its lock height and accepted once the chain reaches
it. Every assertion of Core's own is kept.

`Capability.NODE_WALLET` (`capability.py`) is asked for first, then
`Capability.GENERATE`, the `generatetoaddress` the body mines with, of a
fresh node of the body's own on a clean chain, as Core's
`setup_clean_chain` asks, which it restarts under `-keypool=100`: Core's
`extra_args` start the node with the option, and `bitcoind_cluster`
(`tests/integration/conftest.py`) starts one with none. Core's
`wallet_names` is empty, so its harness creates no wallet, and Core's
`generate` mines to its deterministic key's address, `PRIV_KEYS[0]`
(`test_node.py`); this mines to that same address, which no wallet of
the node holds. The lock heights are Core's own, so the body mines
exactly the blocks Core's file does and no other. Core's
`assert_approx` is `approx` (`wallet_simulaterawtx_test.py`).

`wallet_miniscript_decaying_multisig_descriptor_psbt_bitcoind_test.py`
and `wallet_miniscript_decaying_multisig_descriptor_psbt_btclib_node_test.py`
run it, `tests/integration/conftest.py`'s own module docstring having
how.
