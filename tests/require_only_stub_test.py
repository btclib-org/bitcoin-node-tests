"""A require-only test ends in `pytest.fail`, and asks for what its twin does.

[ISS 82](https://github.com/btclib-org/bitcoin-node-tests/issues/82): a
test whose body is only `del` statements and `require(...)` calls passes
the moment the node under test declares every capability it names,
without the scenario its own name claims ever running. This module is
the AST walk that holds every function under `tests/integration/` to not
being that shape -- parsed rather than imported, since the files it
reads skip themselves without `TF2_INTEGRATION=1`. A stub that still
ends in `del`/`require` alone is the defect this file exists to catch;
one that ends in a terminal `pytest.fail(...)` call is not, whatever
`require` decides once the node it addresses declares more than it does
today.

A stub also drifts from the twin it stands in for: the second walk below
compares a `*_btclib_node_test.py` function's own ordered
`require(...)` capabilities against the `*_bitcoind_test.py` function of
the same name, where one exists, and holds the two to being identical --
no allowance for a capability the stub happens to have dropped, added out
of order, or never asked for at all.
